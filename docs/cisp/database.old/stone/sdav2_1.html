<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>The site was visited by the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1864 (Anon/1864, 352).<p>Rhys/1873, 6: `Aug. 18. -- We went to Penarthur Farm, about three-quaters of a mile from St. David's, to see the wheelcross there'.<p>Westwood/1879, 127 (largely taken from Westwood/1856, 50): `My attention was first directed to this stone by the Rev. J. Jones (Tegid)...It is now used as a gate-post at the entrance of the farmyard called Pen Arthur, half a mile north of St. David's, lately in the occupation of Mrs. Roberts. It was stated to have been found on a moor not far distant from its present locality[2].<p>[2] More recent information states that this and the two other stones next described were originally placed upright around a holy well two fields distant from the farm-house of Pen Arthur (Arch. Camb., 1864, p. 352)'.<p>Westwood/1886, 43--44: `This carved and inscribed stone was first made known to archaeologists in the article published by myself in the Archaeologia Cambrensis for 1856 (Third Series, vol. ii, p. 50). The stone was then used as a gatepost leading to a farmhouse called `Pen-Arthur', half a mile to the north of St. David's, in close proximity to two other ornamented stones which I subsequently represented in the Lapidarium Walliae, Pl. 60, neither of which bears any inscription. I have been informed that all these three stones were originally placed around a holy well two fields distant from the Pen-Arthur farmhouse.<p>Welsh archaeologists will be gratified to learn that these three stones have been rescued from their dangerous situations, where they have been long exposed to injury by passing waggons, etc., and placed for permanent security in the Cathedral of St. David's by the venerable Dean, by whose noble exertions that splendid edifice has been so admirably restored, and where it is hoped, that other outlying stones from the neighbourhood may gradually be brought together, forming, with others already there, a lapidary museum equal in interest to those of Margam Abbey and Llantwit Major.<p>In removing these stones to St. David's it was discovered that the Gurmarc Stone possessed two features which had not been previously observed. First, that the upper left hand angle of the face of the stone was inscribed with several letters, corresponding with the chirho monogram of Christ on the opposite right angle of the stone; and second, that the reverse side of the stone was also carved with a cruciform design. These peculiarities are represented in the accompanying drawings taken from photographs and rubbings kindly forwarded to me by the Dean'.<p>Allen/1896, 295: `Formerly used as a gate-post at Pen Arthur Farm, and now placed within Bishop Vaughan's Chapel in St. David's Cathedral'.<p>Anon/1900, 79--81, records the removal of the stone and provides a excellent drawing of the stones <em>in situ</em> before they were moved.<p>RCAHMW/1925, 348: `The two stones...were used in the fields walls of the neighbouring farm of Pen Arthur prior to their removal to the Cathedral in the year 1885'.<p>Macalister/1949, 174: `From the farm of Pen Arthur, where it was used as a gatepost...now at the west end of the south aisle of St. David's Cathedral'.</em>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 127 (largely taken from Westwood/1856): `we find on the upper right-hand angle the letters X P S, which are the ordinary Greek mode of contraction of the name of Christ, and which was adopted and kept up throughout the middle ages by the Latin Church'.<p>Westwood/1886, 45--52: `Now in usual conjunction with the Greek contraction, xps of the name of Christ, we find the Greek, or rather Graeco-Latin, form of the name of Jesus...contracted first into IHS or IHC or IHS and subsequently into ihs (which also form the initials of the words `Iesus hominum Salvator', adopted as the motto of the Jesuits); and we accordingly arrive at the conclusion that the latter half of the newly discovered part of the Gurmarc inscription represents the ihs.<p>Moreover, in many very ancient stones and MSS. we also find the names of Jesus Christ accompanied by the Alpha and Omega, according to the passage in the first chapter of the Revelations, v, 8. Here then we find, first, the capital A of the ancient form, for Alpha; second, a mark which corresponds with the well-known 7-shaped contraction in MSS. of the word <em>et</em> (and), and then a letter which represents the ancient double vv form of the Omega (w) instead of the more ancient form ([capital Omega ={O}]). We, therefore, thus obtain the formula, Alpha et Omega, ihs and xps <p>The introduction of the initials of the names of the Saviour, or of the Alpha and Omega, at the top of Christian inscriptions appears to have been an evident imitation of the ancient Roman formula, D.M. (<em>diis manibus</em>), applied in similar situations. It is of the greatest rarity in our Christian lapidary monuments, and there is no other instance of the employment of the Alpha and Omega in conjunction with the ihs and xps in Wales than the one now found. In Ireland, one instance of such conjoined forms only is known, which has been published in the Journal of the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland (vol. iv, Fourth Series, Jan. 1883, No. 53, p. 43), found during some works at Glendalough in 1875, of which the preceding is a drawing; from which it will be seen that the ihr xps are preceded by two characters which the author, the Rev. James Graves, gives, together with the three others, as being in almost pure Greek characters, and as representing {A} and {W}, and as belonging to the eighth or ninth century (p. 44), `whilst the archaic form of the Omega would seem to point to even an earlier date'. This letter is combined above with the contraction[1] for <em>et</em>; and when separated from this contraction it is, as here used, carved in many third and fourth century inscriptions in the Catacombs at Rome.[2]<p> <p>The Bishop of Limerick remarks on this Glendalough Stone: `I have not met with an example that I can recollect of the use of the form of Omega, which occurs on this slab of Bresal, at a period more recent than the fourth century. I saw one instance of about that date on a Christian monument in Africa; but we must remember that ecclesiastical fashions of all kinds <p>[1] Dean Reeves reads it thus, `et {w}', and not as a simple {w}. The T~ is equal to ET, and so...equal to  `et {w}'. The line marking the contraction is seen above.' (Footnote, p. 44.)<p>[2] The Benedictines give numerous instances of the introduction of the A and {w} upon coins, diplomas, charters (especially at the headings), etc., in the Nouv. Traite de Diplomatique, vol. ii, pp. 569, 582, 616, and elsewhere. In vol. iii, P1. 37, v, i, they also give a representation, from a MS. of sermons of St. Augustine, etc., of the seventh or eighth century (which afterwards became common) of a cross from the arms of which are suspended the two letters A and w.<p>established themselves at a later period, and continued to prevail down to a later date in Ireland, than in Rome or other places to the east of us. As the Omega you have found on the Glendalough slab seems to be unique, I dare say you are right in regarding it as copied from a Greek MS. which happened to be in the hands of the ecclesiastics living there. (Op. cit., p. 47).<p>In The Book of Armagh, a famous MS. in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy, the passage from the Apocalypse reads, `Ego sum alfa et {w}'; and in the Codex, A. 4, 15, in Trinity College, Dublin, Library, there is a drawing with a {chi-rho}w, the middle monogram representing the contraction xpi; the {chi} being here formed by a horizontal bar crossing the upright stroke of the cross, which was a frequent form of the Chi; whilst the Rho appears above the bar, and the I is formed of the lower part of the vertical stroke of the cross. This is the real meaning of the {P | T} so that it is not equivalent to xps, as stated by the author (p. 46) and by most other writers. In such cases the prefix IN NOMINE (Christi) is understood, especially at the beginning of early charters.<p>It is remarkable that whilst in very many of the early coins of the French monarchy[1] we find the reverse of the pieces marked with the cross, accompanied in that of Clovis I with the A and n, in that of Dagobertus with n and A ; and even in that of the Capetian King, Robert, the A and n are still used, each being suspended by a ribbon from above ; whilst in more numerous instances the cross is accompanied with either A M or M A, which unquestionably represent Alpha and Omega, the M being intended for an angulated w turned upside down. It is still, however, more remarkable that there is not a single instance in the many hundreds of Anglo-Saxon coins figured in Ruding's Annals, in which either the A and w or n, or the ihs or xps are introduced ;<p>[1] See figures of the early French coins, published by Lenoir (Monumens de la France; fol., 1840), and in the first volume of Madame de Witt's recently published Les Chroniquers de France.<p>the only Christian emblems which I can discover amongst them being the Chi, Rho; and Iota conjoined P|X|I in the usual form on the reverse of the coins of Coelnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury (Ruding, Pl. 13) and of Athelwulf (Ibid., P1. 30); and the hand of God extended out of a cloud on the reverse of the coins of Æthelred, either with all the fingers extended, or with only the thumb and first two fingers, in the act of benediction. (Ruding, Pl. 22.) On a vast number of the Anglo-Saxon coins, however, there is in the centre a small cross with four equal arms, which seems placed there, however, only to fill a blank space. <p>With reference to the relative ages of the objects inscribed with the n or its equivalent, w, it must be borne in mind that whilst the former shape of the letter occurs in the oldest Greek inscriptions several centuries before Christ (see the first four Plates of the Palæographical Society's facsimiles), it is never found in MSS. after the birth of Christ, being universally supplanted by the W. In modern printed books the n is used as a capital letter, and the w simply as a minuscule. I only know one instance (given by Boldetti, 351, Munter, Sinnbilder, i, p. 35) in which the n appears for Omega at the side of the labarum.<p>In Wales there is only another instance in which the ihs and xps appeared together, namely on the Stone of St. Gwnnws, still standing in the churchyard of LIanwnnws, Cardiganshire (Lap. Walliae, Pl. 68); on which, however, there is now only the xps remaining at the top right angle of the stone; the left angle, where, doubtless, the ihs existed, being broken off.[1] The Christian monogram is very similar to that employed upon the unique Irish inscribed stone from Glendalough, described and figured above. The upper line of the inscription on the Glendalough Stone is to be read -- `or[oit]do bresal'; that is, a prayer for Bresal.<p>[1] The xps is omitted by Professor Hübner (Christian Inscriptions of Britain, p. 42, No. 122), to whom I sent a copy of the stone, as well as by Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 246).<p>I believe the first character of the lower line on the Glendalough Stone is intended for an Alpha, of which the V-shaped cross-bar, usual in early forms of the Alpha, is replaced by the two middle, detached, vertical strokes.<p>It will be noticed that the monogram of `Christus' on the Glendalough Stone terminates with a recumbent S ( S ), respecting which the Bishop of Limerick remarks that he `takes it to be meant for an s, which itself stands for the Greek Sigma. So the S in IHS stands for the Greek S (Sigma), the fourth letter [third and last letters] of the name of Our Lord' (p. 47). In this unusual position the letter is, however, simply an s, either fancifully, or with the intention of filling up a space, laid prostrate. See the figure of the Gurdon Stone (Lap. Wall., Pl. 35, fig. 2), in which the two letters S in the word `sacerdos' are thus written; also the two letters S in the inscription of the Newcastle coffin-lid (op. cit., Pl. 31, fig. 4); and several other instances are given in N. Tr. de Diplomat., t. ii, Pl. 25 ; VII, v, 2, 3, 5.<p>There is still one other inscribed stone in Ireland which gives the ihs xps, namely the sepulchral slab of Berichtuire at Tullylease in the county of Cork.[1] This is much more elaborately ornamented than the majority of the Irish gravestones given by Miss Stokes, and more nearly resembles some of the Scotch stones. The formula of the inscription is also unique in the Irish stones, and more like that of the Llanwnnws Stone; whilst in the upper right hand angle appears the letters xps; the corresponding left angle being cut off, apparently intentionally (as in the Llanwnnws Stone), on which was, doubtless, the monogram ihs.<p>In Scotland, I believe, the only instance of the introduction of the `A et W' occurs at the top of one of the Kirkmadrine Stones (Stuart, Sculptured Stones of Scotland, ii, Pl. lxxi, p. 35); the letter Omega is much<p>[1] Miss Stokes' Christian Inscriptions in the Irish Language, vol. ii, Pl. 30.<p>defaced, but the two loops at the bottom of the w are clearly visible, a point of importance, with reference to the supposed age of the stone, founded on the form of this letter, as insisted upon by the Bishop of Limerick (p. 47). Below these letters the stone bears the monogram, .~, inscribed within a circle; equivalent to the Chi (written vertically), Rho, and Iota, and not to the xps. <p>In England instances of the employment of the Alpha and Omega are extremely rare, and seem confined to the north of England, and of a very early date. Two small sepulchral stones were dug up in the cemetery of the old church of St. Hilda, Hartlepool, on one of which, inscribed in Runic letters with the name Hildethryth, on the sides of an incised cross, above the arms of which are the A formed as in the Gurmarc Stone, and the Omega formed of a circle divided down the middle by a straight vertical line, evidently intended for an o~ rather than n. Precisely the same formed letters occur on the other stone, inscribed with the name Bei~chtgyd. A fragment of another small sepulchral stone was also found in the restoration of Billingham Church, Durham; in the centre of which is a space, on the left side of the stone, inscribed with a large A; the right hand side of the stone (broken off) having, doubtless, the Omega. The inscription round the edge of the stone, `Orate pro', is in Anglo-Saxon uncial letters, and, as well as those of the Hartlepool stones, may be referred to the seventh century. (Hübner. Inscr. Brit. Christ., pp. 69, 70, 72.) Hübner also (ibid~, p. 80) notices two small pewter masses found in the Thames, one of which is stamped with the labarum, P|X|I within a circle, from the upper arms of which are suspended what appear to be the letters A and n, representing the Alpha and Omega described by the late Mr. A. Way and Mr. Franks. <p>It remains to be mentioned that the reverse side of the Gurmarc Stone is occupied with an incised cross not quite like any other figured in the Lapidarium Walliae, being formed with the four limbs of nearly equal length, and of double incised lines united by a double circular bar, in the manner of the Irish crosses, the extremity of each limb of the cross extending beyond the outer circle'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 127 (largely taken from Westwood/1856): `Anglo-Saxon or Hiberno-Saxon minuscule letters...the inscription beneath the cruciform ornament is cut in letters of the peculiar character which was common throughout the Anglo-Saxon period in England, Wales, and Ireland...the average height of the letters is 2 inches'.<p>Westwood/1886, 44--45: `The newly found portion of the inscription is difficult to decipher, owing to the peculiar forms of the letters and the partial abrasion of the stone. It commences with a large capital A with a long straight bar across the top of the letter, and the middle cross-bar angulated like a small V. This is an early, well known form of the first letter of the alphabet, and it is followed by an angulated stroke with a slight, recurved stroke at its bottom; which, however, may possibly be the bottom of the second stroke of the initial A. Then follow three upright strokes looped together at the bottom, like a small m turned upside down (w). This is followed by a single straight stroke, I; and then there is a broken space caused by the partial scaling oil of the surface of the stone, but in which may be very faintly traced the form of an h; and then there is clearly a large S, agreeing with the terminal S of the right upper angle of the stone'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 207: `Round half-uncials, neatly picked in good style.
