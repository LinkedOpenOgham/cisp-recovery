C. Nicholl, Esq., at Merthyr Mawr, about two miles from the Bridgend Station...Edward Lhwyd thus speaks of this stone in a letter dated from Cowbridge, Sept. 25, 1697, preserved in the Tanner Collection, Bibl. Bodl., Oxford -- Arch. Camb. 1861, p. 231:-- `The inclosed is an old Crosse on ye bank of ye river Ogwr at Merthyr Mawr, a small village of this county...I have been favoured by J. C. Nicholl, Esq., of Merthyr Mawr, with the sight of two manuscript readings and sketches of this and the other cross at that place, made by the late E. Williams (Iolo Morganwg) and Dr. Petrie, the latter of whom visited Merthyr Mawr during the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at Cardiff in 1849 (Arch. Camb. 1849, p. 318)...This stone formerly stood in a hedge within a yard of a stile on Whiting Farm, by the foot-path from Merthyr Mawr to Laleston, before the Merthyr Mawr property came into the possession of the Nicholl family'.<p>Rhys/1899, 158: `In the grounds of Merthyr Mawr, and close to the other cross, stands now another stone which was once doubtless surmounted by a cross: it is said to have formerly stood in a hedge on Witney Farm between Merthyr Mawr and Laleston'.<p>Macalister/1949, 162: `According to Evanson, this stone formerly stood at a place in the village called Croft Daniel, `now a plantation between the cottage and the mill-race'.<p>It was removed to the grounds of Merthyr Mawr House about the same time as No. III [MMWR3/1].<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 57: `On ye bank of ye River Ogwr'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 56: `First recorded by Lhuyd in 1697 as standing on the river bank at Merthyr Mawr,[1] subsequently preserved in the grounds of the mansion and recently re-set within the remains of St. Roque's Chapel there.[2]<p>[1] Stowe MS. 1024, fo. 42 (456--7 of original numbering); <em>Arch.

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Rhys/1899, 160, 163: `In point of bad Latin this inscription goes with the cross of `Samsoni Apati', and not with that of Houelt, but it may be older than either. A study of the non-Latin vocables in it cannot help us to any chronological precision, but it leads to an important conclusion of a somewhat different kind...However that may be, the fact of our finding two or three of the proper names in the inscription, together with the technical name of an office or vocation, to have been Goidelic, proves that we have here indubitable traces of the presence of a Goidelic community, whose language at the time of setting up the cross was still probably Goidelic. All this only makes one feel the more keenly what a pity it is, that we cannot fix the date; but, if my guesses as to the names which the inscription contains should prove well-founded, it must date, before the Irish glosses of the ninth or eighth century'.<p>Macalister/1949, 162: `The interjected invocations of St. Glywys and of the Personage called Nerttan (`Strengthener') are explained with the help of the following stone [OGMOR/1]: the eluciadation of these words is due to Prof. Ifor Williams'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 154: `The loose syntax is characteristic of these late inscriptions'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 16--17: `On its front face it bears an inscription tolerably legible, except the first, fifth, sixth, and last lines, which unfortunately contain the proper names of different persons commemorated by the stone; the top line has in fact the commencement broken off. The remainder reads, so far as a very careful examination of the stone in situ and a number of rubbings enable me to decipher it --<p> <p>...nbelani <p>possuit hanc <p>crucem pro <p>anima ejus <p>scigliuiffi <p>herte(i?)bo <p>et fratris eiu<p>s et pater <p>eius a me <p>prepara <p>tus + st(c?)il(g?)<em>oo</em><p> <p>The first of these lines has been read `conbelini', `convetini', `conboleni', and `conbellini'; the fifth line `scitliuissi' and `sat.....uissi', the sixth line `Nertido et' and `hertibar', and the last line `tus + scio III'. It will be noticed that the two portions of the inscription end with a word commencing alike.<p>Edward Lhwyd [states]: `The first word I read Conbelini,[1] ye same name with Cunobelin, which was ye Roman way of writing the word we call Kynvelin. But I can proceed no further than `Conbelini posuit hanc crucem pro anima ejus'. I have sent ye Vice-Chancellor an other stone [i e.? an account of another stone] from Kaerphilly Castle for ye Museum, but that (I fear me) was more intended for an inscription. I am, Sr yours heartily, whilst E. Lhwyd'.<p>The former [J. C.

Lhwyd's letter of the 20th December, 1702, to the Rev. Humphrey Foulkes, we find the first word spelt differently, probably being a lapsus calami. (It is however to be observed that the stone clearly shews two strokes between the l and n, so that the word must have been either conbelani, as read by Petrie, or conbeloni, or conbellini.) The writer remarks, `I have observed that the Romans and ancient Britains (sic) expressed <em>Kyn</em> in the British names by Cuno, but towards the eighth century both the Brittans and Irish rendered it <em>Con</em>: for the British name Kynvelyn was written by the Romans <em>Cunobelinus</em>, and I found it on an old crosse in Glamorganshire Conbolini: and that (according to their skill in grammar) in the nominative case' (Coll. of W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., copied in Arch. Camb. 1859, p. 248.)'.<p>Rhys/1899, 158--160: `The beginning of the first line is gone, and the <em>p</em> of second line is damaged; but there is the statement of Ed. Lhwyd's, that he read <em>Conbelini posuit hanc crucem pro anima ejus</em>. On my previous visit I read what remains of the first line as <em>nbelini</em>; but, on examining it very carefully again, I have come to the conclusion that Westwood's reading (Lap., p. 16) is the right one. The inscription is a curious mixture of minuscules and somewhat debased capitals, `so that it is hard to say whether <em>u</em> is to be represented as V or as U, and the phases of the R are also impossible to produce exactly in type; but, on the whole, it is the capital R, with a tendency of the last limb to assume a horizontal or even an upward position, while both the T and the L in <em>Scitliuissi</em> are, I should say, rather capitals than not : the three points after this vocable are somewhat doubtful. The C of <em>hanc</em> is rather angular, and so is the first <em>c</em> of <em>Sciloc</em>, which has been sometimes taken for a t. The <em>n</em>'s vary considerably : that of hanc has its first perpendicular prolonged somewhat below the level of the other, while the <em>n</em> of <em>anima</em> looks somewhat like an <em>h</em>; but what I have read as <em>h</em>, in <em>Herttan</em> differs from both, as the top is turned backwards. What I have read <em>tan</em> in Herttan requires notice, as it is partly faint or damaged : I think the first letter a t, and the next letter is imperfect, as there are small breakages which extend from the groove; but I cannot make either <em>b</em> or <em>d</em> of it, though the cracks make it look somewhat like those letters at first sight. It is, I believe, an <em>a</em>, just as the next letter is not an <em>o</em>. This last now looks an oblong, which to my thinking will make nothing but a damaged n. The <em>et</em> is everywhere a conjoint character. The <em>e</em> of <em>ame</em> is doubtful and peculiar, but I think it looks more like <em>e</em> than <em>a</em>; the second <em>a</em> of <em>prepara</em> is also somewhat strange in its form. Lastly, I do not suppose [four dots] is meant to be read <em>est</em> as Westwood supposed : he abstained from suggesting how he construed the whole. For my part, I should regard what follows the points as the name of the man who got the cross ready or designed it, and carried out the work; I am only sorry that I cannot be absolutely certain of his name, but I am decidedly inclined to regard it as <em>Sciloc</em>. According to these guesses the whole would mean : <em>Conbelan posuit hanc crucem pro anima ejus scitlivissi Herttan et fratris ejus et patris ejus: (lapis est) a me preparatus, Sciloc +.</em>'<p>Macalister/1949, 162, `The inscription is...divided by a horizontal stroke after the fifth [line].  This has no apparent meaning: it breaks the sense.'<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 154, `Round half-uncials, coarsely picked in good style, with the normal compendium for <em>et</em>.'<p>RCAHMW/1976, 56, `The Latin inscription, cut in irregular half-uncials...The missing initial letters of the first two lines are provided by Lhuyd's drawing, and though some letters in lines 5--6 are uncertain the forms of the names given here are suggested by their occurrence on the Ogmore stone (No. 926); <em>et</em> is given as a manuscript abbreviation.'</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#conbelani>[Co]nbelani</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Rhys/1899, 160--161: `Beginning with <em>Conbelani</em>, that would seem in point of form to be a genitive of Conbelan. It does not lend itself to comparison with <em>Conbelin</em>, modern Welsh <em>Cynvelyn</em>, for there is no trace known to me of any name like <em>Cynvelan</em>; but as Conbelan-i is formed by adding <em>an</em>, it is possible to guess the sort of name which we have in <em>Conbelan-i</em>. I would suggest <em>Conmail-an</em>, from the Irish name <em>Conmail</em> or <em>Conmael</em>. This, with its <em>ai</em> or <em>ae</em> written <em>e</em>, would give us <em>Conmelan</em>, and as the <em>m</em> must here be softened into <em>v</em>, it admitted of being written <em>b</em>, for which, as will be shown presently, a preference is shown in some Glamorgan inscriptions. In other words, a Goidelic name, <em>Conmaelan</em>, may be the one underlying the <em>Conbelani</em> of our inscription: the weak point of this explanation is that I do not know of an instance of <em>Conmaelan</em> or <em>Conmaelán</em> as an attested name, though <em>Conmael</em> and <em>Mailan</em>, or <em>Maelán</em>, occur'.</em>

Nash-Williams/1950, 154: `Glywys and Nerttan (or Nerttat) are possibly the same persons as those mentioned on No. 255 below'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#sciloc>Sciloc</a> (Language: Goidelic; Gender: male)<br>
Rhys/1899, 162--163: `Lastly, we come to the last name on the stone, <em>Sciloc</em>, of which one can hardly doubt the Goidelicity, as one can scarcely regard it otherwise than as an instance of the numerous endearing or diminutival names in <em>óc</em>. Usually the full or compound name is reduced to its first element, and this termination is appended in the place of the second element: thus an Irish name, <em>Béo-áed</em> is made into <em>Béo-óc</em> or <em>Béóc</em> (Stoke's <em>Martyrology of Corman</em>, p. 335), <em>Biuoc</em> in the Book of <em>Llan Dâv</em>; and <em>Domon-gen</em> or <em>Domon-gin</em> (<em>Dumnogen-</em>, on the Yarrow Stone), into <em>Domnóc</em> (Stokes's <em>Gorman</em>, p. 353). There is no lack of these names in the <em>Book of Llan Dâv</em>, but one of the most remarkable is that of Catoc -- now <em>Cadog</em>. The saint's parents do not seem to have considered such a name as <em>Catoc</em> sufficiently formal, for we read in his `Life' that he was christened Catmail (in modern Welsh <em>Cadfael</em>), as the angel who had foretold his birth to his father had solemnly named him. The `Life', however, informs us, in relation to Cadoc's stay in Brittany, that the men of that country called him <em>Catbodu</em>, which would be in modern Welsh <em>Cadfodu</em> (see the <em>Cambro-Brit. Saints</em>, pp. 25, 27, 69; also the <em>Book of Llan Dâv</em>, pp. 131-2). So it appears that his usual name was <em>Catoc</em>, but that there still was in his time, or later, a surviving trace of the feeling, that the only proper form of the name was a compound beginning with <em>cat, câd</em>, `war, battle, batallion'. This is enough as an illustration, but (see the note on <em>Yssan</em>, from <em>Ysmael</em>, in <em>Owen's Pembrokeshire</em>, p. 307) it would be well if the instances, both Brythonic and Goidelic, were carefully collected and published. To return to the inscription: one can guess with considerable certainty what compound Scílóc or Scilóc represented, namely, <em>Scitliviss-e</em>, that is to say, <em>Scidliviss-e</em> with the dental spirant wholly smoothed away in the more colloquial form; but the sound of the more formal vocable had not as yet been forgotten. In other terms, the name Scílóc was derived in the way suggested from the appellative <em>Scidlivisse</em>, `spy, or bringer of news'. This, if it should prove well founded, would probably mean that, whoever Conbelan was, the man who saw to the preparation of the cross was a member of the family to which Herttan, together with his brother and father, belonged'.<p>Macalister, in Anon/1932, 370: `The name of the maker of the cross might be read Scitoc, Sciloc, and even Scroc; I prefer Scitoc, partly because the same name appears, in the form Scituc, in the <em>Book of Llan Dav</em>'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 154: `Sciloc is apparently the name of the craftsman who carved the cross'.</em>

Rhys/1899, 161--162: `Next comes the word <em>scitliuissi</em>, which I have long regarded as a purely Goidelic compound made up of <em>scitli</em> and <em>vissi</em>: see the second edition of my <em>Celtic Britain</em>, pp. 304--5. The former, <em>scitli</em>, is reduced in Irish to <em>scél</em>, `story or history, news', in Welsh <em>chwedl</em>, `story', plural <em>chwedlau</em>, `news, stories'; and the latter element is related to the Irish word <em>fiss</em>, `knowledge': in Mediaeval Irish the two words were used together as <em>fiss scél</em>, `knowledge of news = information'; and queen Medb in the Táin Bó Cuailngne says that her messengers have brought her <em>fiss scél</em>, `information', as to matters in Ulster, that is in the enemy's country; and in the same story it is said of Cúchulainn that he sent his charioteer to Medb's camp <em>do fhiss scél</em> `to know news' (= `to enquire') whether the warrior with whom he had been duelling on the previous day was still alive: see the Book of the Dun Cow, fo. 55b, 73b. A compound of these words would be <em>scél-fhiss</em>, meaning `knowledge of news = information'; and from this might be made a derivative <em>scélfhiss-e</em> `having news --knowledge, possessed of information', and its genitive case would be <em>scélfhissi</em>: this is what we have, I take it, in an older form as <em>scitli-viss-i</em>.<p>There is a matter of pronunciation and spelling which I ought to have mentioned : <em>scitli-vissi</em> in a still earlier form was probably <em>squedle-vissi</em>; and it is not improbable, I think, that our Welsh <em>chwedl</em>, standing for an earlier <em>suedl-</em>, is borrowed from the Goidelic <em>squedl-</em>, which in its turn is supposed to stand for <em>sequedl</em>, from a root <em>sequ</em>, from which come also say and saga. Now before <em>squedl</em> or <em>scitl</em> dropped its <em>d</em> or <em>t</em>, and yielded O. Irish scel, the dental was probably softened into d or <em>dh</em>, so that the <em>t</em> written in <em>scitlvissi</em> had probably that soft sound, and the fact that <em>chwedl</em> is pronounced whedel in parts of South Wales seems to me to prove, that the sound of modern <em>t</em> was not the original dental in this word'.<p>Anon/1932, 370: `The trouble lies in the interpretation of the word SCITLIUISSI. Rhys has analysed it ingeniously, and interprets it as `tale-teller' or `spy'; but such an interpretation seems to me very doubtful.  There is no evidence that Conbelanus was a king, or any other person of sufficient authority to entitle him to keep a spy; in any case, the last thing a king would do is to advertise the name of his spy, and I fear that the last thing he would worry about would be the soul of his spy! In any case, the philiological basis of the interpretation seems to me questionable, and the syntax is also against it. Even to the writer of dog-Latin like this, it would be natural to put the `eius' <em>after</em> `scitliussi', if he intended any such meaning. There is a precedent at Llantwit for PRO ANIMA EIUS instead of PRO ANIMA SUA; and I would interpret the inscription more simply: `C placed this cross for his [own] soul; the the soul of Scitliuissus [a proper name]; of Herttan [another]; and his brother and father'. Scitoc may be a hypocoristic abbreviation or diminutive of the name Scitliuissus'.</em>

Rhys/1899, 162: `The next name we come to is <em>Herttan</em>, with a <em>tt</em> which ought not to have the same sound as the single <em>t</em> of <em>scitlivissi</em>. In other terms, <em>t</em> having been used in <em>scitlivissi</em> for the soft dental spirant, another symbol, a double <em>tt</em>, was thought necessary in <em>Herttan</em> to represent the unsoftened voiceless mute of the same dental series. But if the pronunciation of the name was <em>Hertan</em> or <em>Ertan</em>, that was not Brythonic or Welsh, but Goidelic'.</em>
