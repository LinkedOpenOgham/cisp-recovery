<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 154--55, `The evidence for this inscribed stone is a hand-written note inserted into the 1716 manuscript of Dom Louis Le Pelletier's <em>Dictionnaire de la langue bretonne</em>. The information was incorporated into the preface in the later `Lesquiffiou manuscript' of the dictionary but was omitted from the final printed version. The stone and its inscription therefore remained unknown until the reference was rediscovered by G. Le Menn and published by him in 1981, Gildas Bernier also discussing it the following year. The only known illustration is Le Pelletier's sketch of the lettering, which exists in two versions, both reproduced by Le Menn, who suggests that since the note is on an inserted leaf it must have been written after the manuscript had been completed.<p>When Le Pelletier saw the stone, perhaps shortly after 1716, it was set at the corner of a house in the <em>rue du bourg</em> of Saint-Michel-en-Grève. The <em>bourg</em> of Saint-Michel is ranged on either side of an old road, today known as <em>la voie romaine</em>, `the Roman road', with the churchyard lying at the southern end of this street.<p>The site was visited by members of the CISP team in April 1997, October 1998, and June 1999'.</em>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 157: `The inscription is in capitals. Some of the letters, such as the first M, the As and possibly the I, may have been serifed. The O is shown as square, and is paralleled elsewhere in Brittany, France, and the Rhineland, while the E is curved and the D is angular, with the bow tapering to a point. The L is backward, and is another example of the backward and retrograde letters known elsewhere in Brittany. <p>In the upper drawing AEL is drawn as conjoined, while in the lower it is only EL that is conjoined. The joining of letters in this way would be unusual, to say the least, and it looks as if the joining lines may have been added by the draftsman, which would thereby bring into question the detail of the drawing. Nonetheless, the M/A ligature is found elsewhere in Brittany, as in one inscription from Bais [BAIS/2]. The drawing of the three angle-bar As, and the square O, as well as the fact that the inscription is largely intelligible, inspires some confidence; indeed the combination of serifed capitals, with rounded E, angular D, and square O, point to a date of carving in the second half of the 6th or the 7th century'.</em>

His second copy, in the Lesquiffiou Manuscript, is very close and adds little. ... It remains easier to make sense of the stone, however, if read as Le Pelletier presents it'.</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#maeldoi>Maeldoi</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Davies et al/2000: `MAELDOI. The element mael from Old Celtic maglo-  `prince' is extremely common in all the Brittonic languages as a masculine personal name element: thus, for example, OB Maeloc, Maelcar, Maelcat, Maelhoiarn, Maeluethen, Conmail, Cunmail, etc. As a common noun, however, it is rare and occurs only in early Welsh poetry. The use of the cognate OIr. mál `prince' is similarly restricted to early poetry, but is not common in personal names.<p>-DOI may correspond to Middle and Modern Breton doue `god' < Indo-European *deiwo-, giving OW duiu and OIr. día; compare also doiuis `goddess'. This element is attested in early Breton personal names, but is not very common: for example, Doenerth in the Cartulary of Quimper, the same name as Duenerth in the Cartulary of Quimperlé < Celtic *dewo- + *nerto- `strength, strong'. That name occurs in Wales as Dounerth, Deunerth, and Duinerth for an individual flourishing in the earlier 8th century. (The reading Duiu-uuoret of CR no. 162 is an error for Dumuuoret.) The final -i could be read either as part of the native word doi or as a fortuitous coincidence of the Breton root and Latin second-declension genitive ending.<p>As to dating by phonology, Mael- from older Magl- does not appear before the later 6th century; nor does the syncope from the older *Maglo-de:wos. Celtic de:wo- became Brittonic doiu or duiu in the mid-7th to mid-8th century, according to Jackson. Therefore, if this element does correspond to later Breton doue, a date later than c. 650 is indicated'.</em>
