<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Latin (rbook)
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 145: `With regard to the peculiar formula of this inscription it appears to have been in use in Ireland in the, eighth and ninth centuries. In the Gospels of Mac Regol in the Bodleian Library we have an entry, (`Quicumque legeret et intellegeret istam narrationem orat pro Mac Reguil scriptori'), and in the cross at Tullylease, Ireland (Irish Inscriptions, vol. ii. P1. XXX), we have a curious identity with the Llanwnnws stone, the figure of the cross being supplemented at top on the right-hand with the <em>xps</em> and the inscription being `Quicumque hunc titulum legerit orat pro Berechtuire'.<p>Rhys/1905, 96--97, discusses the linguistics of the name and the metre of the inscription as a whole.<p>Macalister/1949, 141: `The formula is similar to that on stones at Tullylease, Cork (908), and Llanveynoe, Hereford, and was probably suggested by a passage in the inscription of Eliseg (1000). The word NOMEN doubtless refers to the sacred Name represented in abbreviation above the cross'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 102: `The phrase <em>explicaverit hoc nomen</em> refers to the (contracted) name at the top of the stone; for the latter see No. 380. The formula used in the inscription recurs in Wales on No. 82 (dated early 9th century) and in Ireland, in variant forms, in the Gospels of MacRegol (c. 800) and on the well-known Tullylease cross-slab (dated 839)'.</em>

The stone was figured by Sir S. Meyrick (Cardiganshire, P1. VII. fig. 6), but the middle and end of the inscription were incorrectly read'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 102: `Round half-uncials...cut in good style. The abbreviations used are those normally employed in manuscripts of the period. In l.1 Q with suprascript I is the normal Irish (and Welsh) contraction for <em>qui</em> from the 8th century onwards. U~ (for <em>uer</em>) in l. 3 and H with a dot over it (for <em>hoc</em>) and N~O~ (for nomen) in 1.4, the two latter representing abbreviations by suspension, are also normal. The D's with closed loop and inclined tail are an Irish form met with at Clonmacnois and elsewhere'.<p>The words Hiroidil Filius have been omitted from Nash-William's translation, by typographic error?</em>

Westwood/1879, 145: `It is this inscription which is referred to in the Myvyrian Archaeology, p. 422, where the name is given as Canotinn (respecting the existence of which inquiry is made by Professor Rhys, Arch. Camb., 1873, p. 198). In the former work the name is considered to be identical with Kynydyn ap Bleddid, one of the early Welsh saints, whilst on the other hand local tradition would connect the inscription with the name of Caradog, there being a waterfall called Pwll Caradog close by. In the `Notes' of Professor Rhys this stone is twice referred to, which evidently led Professor Hübner to consider the two notices as referring to different stones, numbered 122 and 123 in his `Inscriptiones,' p. 42, but he was enabled to correct this error by subsequent information received from Professor Rhys...Professor Graves suggested that the name Carotinn looks very like Maccarthin, an old ecclesiastical name in Ireland, and Professor Rhys states that the name `admits of being equalled letter for letter with the Irish Cairthinn. More to the north of Cardiganshire there is a farm, about two miles from Ponterwyd, called Nantcaredin or Nante(a)redyn, which is commonly supposed to be Nant cae y rhedyn, but it seems not improbable that Caredin is the modern form of our Carotinn''.<p>Rhys/1905, 97: `<em>Carotinn</em>, Modern Welsh <em>Carodyn</em>, meant a lover or a friend; but I  have never met either [name]...anywhere else as proper names'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#hiroidil>Hiroidil</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Westwood/1876, 145: `With regard to the proper names upon this stone, Professor Rhys suggests that `Hiroidil= Hir-oidil, where Oidil probably stands for Guoidil, which occurs as a man's name in the Liber Landavensis, pp. 200, 202. Hir is of course the ordinary adjective meaning `long'''.<p>Rhys/1905, 97: `<em>Hiroidil</em> is a dissyllable, the last <em>i</em> being an irrational vowel which would have been written <em>y</em> in Medieval Welsh : in Modern book Welsh the name would be <em>Hirhoedl</em> `long-lived'.  In Old and Medieval Welsh <em>r</em> represented both <em>r</em> and <em>rh</em>. and here we have a very decided instance of the latter value, as the name is a compound <em>Hir-hoedl</em>. ...I have never met... <em>Hiroidil</em> anywhere else as [a] proper name.' Jackson/1953, 337: sees HIROIDIL as ninth-century evidence for the development of an `epenthetic vowel in certain groups of final consonants in monosyllables'.</em>
