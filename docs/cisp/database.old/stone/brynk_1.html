<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>recognised, 1902 unknown
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>The stone was brought to the attention of Rhys in 1902 by Mr. R. Pritchard Evans, but none of the reports mentioned exactly who first noticed the inscription, which was revealed when the stone was moved. It was possibly the tenant farmer who had moved it, Evan Jones (Rhys/1903, 255--256, see below). All the earliest photographs (e.g. Anon/1903, 289; Rhys/1903, 257) show the stone with the text horizontal at the top, but when Rhys first saw the stone it was set on the present right-hand edge, on which is found the ogham inscription (Rhys/1907, 97). Before publication of the stone, it was moved again and the photographs taken, but the ogham is not visible in these pictures (Rhys/1903, 258). In 1904, during a visit of the Cambrian association (Anon/1904, 149), the `Venerable Archdeacon Thomas' noticed the ogham (Rhys/1907, 97). Rhys managed to visit the stone again in September 1904 by which time it had been moved once more to the farm-house (Rhys/1907, 97).<p>Rhys/1903, 256: `The stone may be said now to be a gate post, except that there is no gate there; in fact, it forms the end of a hedge where a gate or hurdle might be set up.  The farmer found it at a spot not far off, which he showed us; it lay flat with one of its corners protruding inconveniently near a gap in the hedge. So he undertook to remove it, but he was surprised to find it so large and heavy, and when he got it clear he thought it would do for the unsafe position where I saw it, so he had it placed on a sledge and moved thither without any damage, so far as he knows, occuring to it'.<p>RCAHMW/1960, 95: `A large stone was found <em>ca.</em> 1901 embedded by a gateway...and was set up for use as a gatepost. A Latin inscription was noticed, and later, when the stone was moved...for safety and set the right way up, an Ogam inscription became visible'.</em>

As it then stood [after its first move], the writing read downwards, near and parallel to the thickest edge of the stone; the opposite edge was both thinner and more irregular, as if the stone had been longer originally in that direction. The following rough sketch will explain what I mean:<p>a+----------------------------------------+b<p> |                       ICORIFILIVI |<p> |                          POTENTI  |                  <p> |                                      NI |<p> |                                          |<p> |                                          |<p> |                                          |<p> |                                          |<p>c+----------------------------------------+d<p>The edge <em>ab</em> is the thick one and <em>cd</em> the thinner and more irregular, which makes me fancy the stone has been shortened by the breaking off of a piece along <em>cd</em>...There is...no certain sign of [the stone] having been broken off along <em>bd</em>. In fact that edge together with <em>ab</em> and <em>ac</em> seem to me to show, with the exception of a certain breakage near the top of <em>bd</em>, such rounding that one cannot help concluding that it was so, speaking roughly, when the letters were cut and long before.<p>The later find of ogham on edge <em>bd</em> shows that the stone had not been broken or trimmed along that edge'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 86: `Rough pillar-stone'.<p>RCAHMW/1960, 95: `rough pillar-stone of slab shape'.</em>

The latter hypothesis was strengthed when the ogham inscription was later found (Rhys/1907, 100).</em>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Rhys/1903, 259--262, gives a long discussion of this inscription offering several different ways of breaking it down into words, and detailed linguistic comments. This is largely made redundant by the later discovery of the ogham inscription which confirms the reading of the first word as a single name, and the reading of the final letter as a half-uncial S.<p>Rhys/1907, 100, says, `it is impossible to regard IC as standing here for the Latin <em>hic</em>, as I wrote before seeing the Ogam'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Rhys/1903, 258: `Now as to the letters themselves they are on the whole fairly well cut, and there is nothing peculiar about their form, excepting that the connecting bar of the first N joins the perpendiculars at some distance from their nearest ends respectively; the result is somwhat of an approach to an H. And I should have said that the other N is considerably wider than the first. There is a difficulty, however, about the reading of the wider N, for the first part of the letter is not clear, owing to the stone being uneven at that point and slightly damaged, probably when it was recently removed to where it is. There is another imperfect letter, namely the last in the first line. It is here represented provisionally as an I, but that is not the reading, as it has a line at right angles to it suggesting the lower bar of an F, but as the top is gone it might just as well be the first portion of a P, or even of an A, excepting that one would hardly expect the first limb of an A to be perpendicular, which is the case here.  Unfortunately, the epitaph supplies no A for one to compare, but instances undoubtedly occur of the letter A having its first limb perpendicular or very nearly so. Whatever the imperfect letter was, I see no possibility of reading it as an S of any kind, though that would have completed the word <em>filius</em> and spared us some serious difficulties, among them that of fixing how many letters followed, if any, and which they were. At all events I think that the inscriber must have tried to finish the word following FILI on the edge, so that he cannot have had many letters to write there...When Mr. Evans sent me a facsimile I felt certain that there must have been a line before the one beginning with ICORI, but the first glance at the rounded form of the top of the stone and its thickness showed me how that is utterly impossible'.<p>Macalister/1945, 362: `The S of FILIVS is half-uncial, and is dropped a little beneath the line to which it belongs. It has an extension upward, running into a natural fracture, which makes it look like an F. The last two letters are below, in a third line: the first upright of the N is injured by flaking'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 86: `Roman capitals, with half uncial s'.<p>RCAHMW/1960, 95: `The top right-hand corner of one face bears the inscription...in Roman capitals with half-uncial S, crowded to the edge of the stone. The last N is disjointed and could be a V with a natural mark to the left'.</em>

Rhys/1903, 260: `The name <em>Potentinus</em> occurs in one of the Roman inscriptions at Caerleon, and we have <em>Potenina</em>, which looks like a mistake for <em>Potentina</em>, on a post-Roman stone found at Tregaron, in the neighbourhood of the Roman site of Llanio, in Cardiganshire. <em>Potentinus</em>, as a derivative from <em>potens</em>, `powerful, strong', has its parallel in Irish in the name <em>Ceithernach</em>, which comes from medieval Irish <em>cethern</em> or <em>ceithern</em>, in Welsh <em>cadarn</em>, `<em>potens</em>, strong, ablebodied', literally `fit for war', from<em>cad</em>, `battle', Irish <em>cath</em> of the same meaning; but the Irish word <em>cethern</em> has only come down in the sense of `soldiers', or rather perhaps a `band of soldiers', as it is used in the singular with a plural meaning, and has been borrowed into Welsh as such, while in English it became <em>kern</em> and <em>cateran</em>'.<p>Rhys/1907, 101--102, repeats this discussion.</em>
