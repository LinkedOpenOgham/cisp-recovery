<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Macalister/1916, 147--148: `This very important monument was smashed in pieces, which were collected and cemented together by the Board of Works. Wakeman found only one of the fragments -- the sinister arm -- and copied the inscription on its edge in the Ordinance sketches...This sketch is reproduced in CIIL, but in the letterpress of the untrustworthy work there is a hopeless confusion between this stone and the <em>Dechenboir</em> monument [ICLTA/1]... and the further erroneous statement is made that the stone has disappeared. It is strange that Wakeman made no reference to the ornamentation on the face of the fragment which he found. In the Board of Works Report, the interlacing work with which the face of the stone is covered is sketchily indicated, and there is a creditable but not completely successful attempt at reading the inscription on the sinister edge...We have seen that Wakeman and the Board of Works have given partial readings of the inscription on the sinister side. But that on the dexter side has never been noticed before, so far as I can find. It must, of course, have been seen dozens of times, as it is obvious to anyone entering the church; but no one seems to have taken the trouble to try to read it'.</em>

The other face is quite plain.<p>The sculptured face is so badly weathered that at first sight it seems absolutely impossible to make out the ornament. The decipherment offered on the accompanying Plate is the result of a microscopic examination of every square centimetre of the face of the cross -- a task that occupied the better part of two days, followed by four days spent over a number of rubbings. Even with every care, I cannot feel sure that I have made out the whole pattern beyond the possibility of cavil; the stone is too far gone to allow anyone that satisfaction. The most doubtful part is the central pattern of spirals. The spirals are there, though they have to be very carefully looked for; the fret in the middle is also fairly distinct. But when it comes to linking the spirals up, one with another, the would-be decipherer is confronted with ambiguities between which he must be content to choose the most probable.<p>The panel on the sinister side of the base remains intact, but that on the dexter side is almost entirely lost; and the small portion that remains is not sufficient to tell us what device it bore. The remaining panel bears in rather high <em>cavo rilievo</em> the figure of an animal, from whose mouth depends the leg of a man. This device is familiar in Halstatt art; it appears several times on the famous figured buckets of the early Iron Age. But it is curious to find it in a monument of Celtic Christian art.<p>On each of the edges of the stone is an inscription...Above the horizontal arm the edge is quite plain. The end of the sinister arm has a simple quasi-key pattern and a similar design was probably cut on the opposite end, but is now quite worn away'.</em>

Macalister/1916, 149: `The artist's name was therefore a diminutive of the well-known name Tórna. Nothing seems to be recorded of this Tórnóc who was probably a stonecutter, and at the same time an inmate of this monastery; but it is at least satisfactory to recover from oblivion the name of one more of the sculptures of ancient Ireland, and to know his precise date'.</em>
