<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Okasha/1970, 68, `The stone...came to light in March 1967 on Ramsey Island, Pembrokeshire. It was found by Mr. Richard Alison in the garden of the farm-house lying among debris of various kinds. No other inscribed stones were found with it.  However, in March 1963 the farm-house was rebuilt and the contractor, Mr. E. B. Hopper, then found five or six head stones containing markings outside the front door of the house. They were lying flat, but Mr. Hooper spoke to someone who could remember them standing upright. There were graves nearby with which Mr. Hooper assumed the stones were associated. Accidentally the stones were then used in the re-building, and are not now visible. It is possible, but by no means certain, that this present stone is one of the ones which escaped re-use at that time. Mr. C. D. Shaw arranged for the stone to be brought to London for examination, and subsequently for it to be presented to the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff'.</em>

Moreover there is too little ornament remaining to make possible an artistic dating. An epigraphic dating depends on whether the text is considered in the context of Welsh or Anglo-Saxon inscriptions. A comparison of the the letter-forms of surviving Welsh inscriptions suggests that either a fifth- to seventh-century, or an eleventh- to thirteenth-century date is most probable. However, the present text bears a much closer resemblance to early Anglo-Saxon inscriptions. Judged by the epigraphic dating criteria adduced for these, the text appears to use early forms of B, N, S and possibly V, suggesting that an eighth- to ninth-century date is likely. The historical evidence is inconclusive since Ramsey Island shows signs of habitation from Roman times onwards, and inscribed stones from the fifth century on have been recorded in Pembrokeshire. In this connection it should be noted that in 1860 `Graves were opened in digging in front of the present dwelling house'. The date of the stone therefore remains uncertain, although an eighth- to ninth-century date seems most likely to the present writer'.</em>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Okasha/1970, 68--69: `The remaining text consists of incised letters c. 3.2 cm high by c. 0.6 cm wide...The text is in a capital script employing insular, and angular, B and two forms of V. Serifing, either full, half or split, is consistently employed. The particular form of S is unparalleled on Welsh inscriptions. However it appears on the fragmentary stone cross-head from Carlisle, and the decorative capitals of some Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, notably the St. Chad Gospels. The script is not typical of Welsh inscriptions, the majority of which employ half uncials. However inscriptions, dating from the fifth to the seventh centuries and from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, do use capitals, though none of those illustrated by Nash-Williams has such regular and ornamental forms as appear on this stone. A Celtic parallel does occur in the ninth-century stone from Lethnot, Angus [CIIC 509]. However, the script of the present stone is much more similar to that of early Anglo-Saxon inscriptions and manuscripts'.</em>

Okasha/1970, 69: `If the text is complete as it stands it may be read <em>s(a)tvrnbiv</em>. Professors Jackson and Jones suggested independently that this was the Old Welsh name <em>Saturnbiu</em>. Professor Jackson tentatively identified this with the first recorded Bishop of St. David's <em>Saturnbiu Hail</em>, `the generous', whose death is recorded in <em>s.a.</em> 831. Professor Jones also noted that the form <em>Saturnbiu Cam Ibiau</em> occurs twice in the eigth of ninth century part of the book of St. Chad.  It is otherwise rare.<p>Alternatively, the text might be incomplete and could contain two names, for example <em>Saturn</em> and one commencing <em>Bi-</em>; Nash-Williams recorded stones with the names <em>Saturninus</em> and <em>Bivadus</em>, <em>Bivatigirnus</em>. Finally, the text could be incomplete at both ends and contain the end and the beginning of two words or names, in Latin or Welsh. If it does contain a personal name or names, however, the text is likely to be commemorative'.</em>
