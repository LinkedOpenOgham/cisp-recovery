<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 258--59: `This inscribed slate comes from a cemetery at Bourg Saint-Pair (Bais), identified prior to building construction thanks to a rescue excavation directed between September 1986 and May 1987 by Philippe Guigon, who was not however given access to supervise the dismantling of cist-graves found there. The slate was discovered during excavation, in situ, within a slate cist-grave (grave 95). This grave was stratigraphically the earliest of a group of four (graves 95-97 and 106), itself forming part of the excavator's `Group 12'; the cist-grave measured 170 x 53 x 33cm, at a depth of 28cm, and was oriented north-south.<p>A large slab covered almost the whole of the grave. The inscribed stone was one of three slates underneath this cover, apparently one piece broken in three, face up, directly across the feet of the skeleton, which was undisturbed. The skeleton was that of a female. On either side of the skull were two rings of heavily oxidized, tinned bronze (estimated diameter 2.8cm) which appear to have been earrings. No other grave goods were found in the group.<p>The slate was examined by members of the CISP team in May 1997 and June 1999, and the site was visited at the latter date'.</em>

Their most distinctive feature is the round hole, 0.3-0.4cm in diameter, at the ends of each vertical and oblique stroke. These holes, much deeper than the well formed strokes which join them, have been drilled. Their purpose was presumably to stop the very friable stone fracturing when the strokes were incised. That this was a problem is evident from the small pieces of slate which have dropped out of the A and the D. That this flaking took place during the actual carving of the inscription is shown by the cross-bar of the A, which was carved within the area of flaking'.</em>

The D/O are ligatured, with the O carved as a three-sided square attached to the bow of the D. Other square Os are known from Breton inscriptions, at Plouagat and Saint-Michel-en-Grève [PLAGT/1, SMGRV/1]. The R is open-bowed and has a raised `foot' similar to the examples on I3 [BAIS/3], also from Bais, as well as from Crac'h and Guer [CRACH/1 and GUER/1]. The forms of the L, E, and O support the Merovingian dating suggested by Guigon/1994, 97, with a likely date of carving in the 6th or 7th century'.</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#beladore>Beladore</a> (Language: latinised celtic; Gender: female)<br>
Davies et al/2000, 262--63: `A name <em>Belator</em> or <em>Bellator</em> is well attested in the Western Empire: <em>Belator</em> from Bath, <em>Bellatoris</em> from York, and <em>Bellator</em> from Silchester. From France and the Rhineland, we find <em>Bellator</em> at Cologne and at Langres, and <em>Bellatoricis</em> (nominative <em>?*Bellatorix</em>) at Pfaffenhofen. <em>Bellator</em> occurs four times in North Africa. Note also, surviving in a late Gallo-Latin milieu, the name <em>Bellatur</em> on a 5th-century inscription from Arles.<p>There is a Latin common noun <em>bellator</em> `warrior', and <em>bellator deus</em> is used for Mars by Vergil (<em>Aeneid</em> 9, 721). Nonetheless, Kajanto argues that the personal name <em>Bel(l)ator</em> is `Celtic'.<p>An Old Celtic name element <em>belatu-</em> (always first in compounds) is well attested: for example, masc. <em>Belatu-dunum-</em>, <em>Belatullus</em>; fem. <em>belatulla</em>, <em>Belatumara</em>. The Pannonian <em>Beladius</em>, whose epitaph was found at Boulogne-sur-Mer, probably bore a Celtic name based on this same root. In Roman Britain, the theonym <em>Belatucadrus, developing to Belatucairus and Belatucaurus</em> is abundantly attested, clustering in the northern military zone about Hadrian's Wall in Cumbria. This god is very often equated with Mars.<p>The fluctuation between <em>Belator</em> and <em>Bellator</em> and the regular identification of Romano-British <em>Belatucadrus</em> with Mars suggest the following explanation: a Romano-Celtic <em>*Belato-rix</em>, <em>*Belato-rigis</em> was Latinized as 3rd-declension <em>Belator</em>, <em>Belatoris</em> and then naturally taken by Latin speakers as <em>Bellator</em>, <em>-is</em> `warrior' (with double -ll-), as if derived from <em>bellum</em> `war'. <em>Belatu-</em> and its compounds do not appear otherwise as Breton or Welsh personal names.<p>In the present inscription, therefore, a single-element name <em>Belado</em> (< Celtic <em>*Belatu</em>) is not impossible, but would lack exact parallels.<p>Bernier (apud Guigon) is probably correct that <em>Beladore</em> here, if that be the correct reading, is neither Latin nor Germanic but Celtic (Guigon/1994, 97). Therefore, <em>Beladore</em> could be either Brittonic or Gallo-Latin. The forms with single <em>-l-</em> seem to be confined to areas which were, or had been, Celtic-speaking. In this case, if a woman's name, the analogical pressure to identify the root with `war' and Mars, and thus double the <em>-l-</em>, would have been weak. The inflexion has probably been assimilated to that of the Latin (from Greek) <em>Theodora</em>, which would also help to explain the <em>-d-</em> in place of more common <em>-t-</em>. The final syllable of <em>Beladore</em>, if that be the correct reading, is probably the Latin case ending, classical feminine first declension <em>-ae</em>. That ending might also have fortuitously converged with the reduced final syllable of a Celtic <em>-rix</em> name. <em>-Rix</em> names are known for females elsewhere, e.g. Romano-British Tanco-rix [Collingwood/Wright/1965, no. 908] and AVITORIA FILIA CVNIGNI, ogham INIGENA CUNIGNI AVITTORIGES (EGLWC/1], where Celtic <em>*Awito-rix</em> has been treated as a Latinized feminine in the Latin text. Latinized genitive <em>Belador(a)e</em> from Celtic <em>*Belatu-rix</em> would be directly comparable to Avitoria'.</em>
