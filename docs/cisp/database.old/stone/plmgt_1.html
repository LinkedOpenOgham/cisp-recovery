<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 237--38: `When Charles de Keranflec'h first saw this stone, it was in the cemetery at Plumergat. He noted two inscriptions and a cross. The more recent of the two texts presented no difficulties and he read it with ease, dating it at that stage to the 8th or 9th century. The more ancient, however, was problematic. He thought that the first line was missing, but the script -- rustic Roman capitals -- indicated a pre-6th-century date to him. All this he presented to the Quimper Congress of the Association bretonne [Keranflec'h/1858: 338-39].<p>Louis Rosenzweig gave a presentation on the stone at the Sorbonne in Paris a few years later. He was the first to attempt a reading, but could not identify the language in which it was written [Rosenzweig/1864: 156, 158]. Keranflec'h returned to the topic at the end of his life at the Saint-Brieuc Congress of the Association bretonne; he made a rubbing and attempted a reading, interpreting the language as `Old Armorican' [Keranflec'h/1897: 4--6]. Marsille later suggested that this text was pre-5th-century AD. … It has been edited … by Lambert [Lambert/1994: 107].<p>The site was visited by members of the CISP team in May 1997, and May and June 1999'.</em>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Gaulish (rcaps)
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 242--44: `Where readable and susceptible to interpretation, the inscription is definitely Old Celtic, rather than Dark-Age Brittonic or Old Breton.<p>V[..]PQS. Unlike the earlier readings, the form on the first line cannot be so readily made into a name. <p>RI[.]OVT could be a verb, verb-second being the most common syntax in Gaulish sentences. One is reminded of the very common Gaulish dedicatory element <em>auot</em>, which perhaps means `granted', like the Early Welsh <em>aw</em> `grant, bestow'. The development of <em>auot</em> to <em>-out</em> would be consistent with the proposed Late Gaulish dating. If so, <em>ri-</em> may be the Celtic `perfective' preverb, corresponding to OB and OIr. <em>ro</em>, Celtiberian <em>ro</em>, OW <em>ri</em>, Gaulish <em>ro</em> and <em>re</em>. Hence, we may consider translating `has granted' or the like, a plausible sentiment in a dedicatory inscription.<p>AT/ER/EB/O. As previously recognised by Bernier, Lejeune, and Lambert, this is clearly the Old Celtic word for `father' in the native, as opposed to Latin, dative plural, hence `to the fathers'. The second syllable in the present reading is likely to be a secondary development from older <em>*atribo</em>, <em>*atrebo</em>, under the influence of the nominative singular <em>atir</em> (Larzac) and the stem <em>*ater-</em>. It is also possible that in a Late Old Celtic language that was losing internal unstressed syllables, <em>aterebo</em> might have arisen by what is called a hypercorrection, i.e. a false restoration.<p>AT/E[MI]N/T/O-B/O is most easily taken as another dative plural, in agreement with <em>aterebo</em> `the fathers'. There is an Early Welsh adjective <em>etuynt</em>, which has been taken to mean `wise, prudent, discreet, deliberate, thoughtful' (GPC sn. <em>edfynt</em>), hence implying an old compound <em>*ate-mento-</em> `back again' + `mind', so `thinking back, reflecting' or perhaps `remembered, commemorated'. Thus, <em>...ri[.]out aterebo atem[.]ntobo</em> may be translated `X has granted [this] to memorialize [his] male ancestors...<p>D/VRN-BO. Breton <em>dorn</em> means `hand' (from older <em>*durn</em>), equivalent to Welsh <em>dwrn</em> `fist'. In the former sense, `hand' may be used to signify possession in the Celtic languages. If <em>-bo</em> is again the dative plural ending, `in the hands of X' would mean `in possession of X', as in the OW `Surexit Memorandum', where <em>i.lau Elcu</em>, literally `in the hand of Elcu', means `in the possession of Elcu'.<p>D/VRN-BOGIAPO. Alternatively, <em>durn</em> + <em>bogia-</em> may be a compound of `hand' + `break', cf. OIr. <em>bongaid</em> `breaks'. If so, <em>durn(o)bogia-</em> could signify an object carved by hand, a sculpture or inscription. <em>-Po</em> here is likely to be an orthographic variant of the dative plural ending <em>-bo</em>, occurring repeatedly earlier on. Altogether then, one would translate `X bestowed [this stone] as hand carvings memorializing the male ancestors'.<p>However one takes the segment with <em>durn</em>, the word is more likely to mean `hand' rather than `fist' here. This is interesting in showing that on this one point the dialect of Armorica in Late Antiquity anticipates Breton usage in a way that innovates from Common Celtic and differs from Welsh.<p>Whether the language of the inscription is Gaulish, rather than Brittonic, cannot be put beyond doubt by purely linguistic criteria. At some point before the emergence of Welsh, Breton, and Cornish, Brittonic replaced the inherited form ati:r `father' with the homely baby-talk word tat. However, there is no certainty that the older word ati:r (or its dative plural at(e)rebo) had disappeared in Brittonic as early as the 4th century'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 242: `The inscription is in capitals, although the lettering is different from the slimmer and more ordered Roman capitals of other Gallo-Latin inscriptions. It is largely comprised of heavily ligatured letters, a feature seen by Knapp to date from the 3rd century AD onwards [Knapp/1992: 383]. Some of these ligatures are common elsewhere, such as RE with the R facing backwards; others, such as NTO, DV, and BO, are less so. The quality of the lettering is quite poor, with letters such as the P of the first line leaning to the right, while the middle characters of the fourth line have been carved in such a way as to make a reading problematic. There is a probable backwards S in the first line. The presence of an open-bowed R, as well as an R with shortened and wide-angled oblique strokes, points to a Late Roman date, while the poor quality of the lettering, the large number of ligatures, and the inconsistent slope of the letters are all reminiscent of Roman mile-stones such as RIB [Collingwood/Wright/1965] nos. 2222 and 2249, of the 3rd and 4th centuries respectively. [A] dating of 'Late Antique' appears corroborated, with a probable date for this carving in the 3rd or 4th century'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Legibility:</strong><td>poor<br>Davies et al/2000, 238--39: `Some of the letters are deeply cut but all are weathered, to varying degrees, with those closer to the top more affected. The top two lines are particularly badly weathered and were unnoticed by all authorities before Bernier. The third and fourth lines are in quite good condition; the fifth is only fair and the sixth is again quite good. The damage and poor preservation of the text sometimes make it difficult to read'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 245--46: `This is probably a bithematic (two-element) Celtic personal name of a standard kind.<p>RI-. The first element is the very common name element <em>ri</em>, OW <em>ri</em>, OIr. <em>ri</em>, British <em>rix</em>, etc. Here, it is probably the first element of a close compound, thus going back to Celtic <em>rigo-</em>. Spellings, like <em>Riothamus</em> < <em>*Rigotamos</em>, show that the <em>-g-</em> had already been lost amongst the continental Britons by the mid-5th century. Here, the following syllable has also dropped, probably putting the language past the middle of the 6th century.<p>-MOETE. <em>a muoet</em> is found as a 9th-century OB gloss on Latin <em>fastu</em>, thus meaning 'by ostentation'. <em>Moet</em> is common in OB personal names, presumably in a more positive sense, `majestic, noble': e.g. <em>Moet-gen</em> (CR no. 30), <em>Moet-nou</em> (no. 252), <em>Uuor-moet</em> (nos. 96, 13). The final vowel <em>-e</em> is probably the Latin first-declension genitive ending, classical <em>-ae</em>.<p>The declension suggests a feminine and women's names with Celtic `king' are attested, e.g. the <em>Tancorix</em> commemorated near Hadrian's Wall [OLDCA/1]. Hence, although there are no OB women's names with <em>Ri-</em> in Claude Evans's collection, it is best understood as a woman's name [Evans/1988].<p>The initial <em>-m-</em> is probably lenited, that is pronounced as a nasalized <em>/v~/</em>. The fact that this is still written <em>m</em>, and not <em>u</em> or <em>v</em>, rules out a Middle Breton date and makes a date of 10th-century or earlier the more likely'.</em>
