Camb. 1858, p. 345), but which has since I believe been removed to the chapter-house at Margam. A description and figure of it were published by me in the Archaeologia Cambrensis for 1851, p. 147. It is interesting for the rudeness of the inscription, the simplicity of its design, and the illustration it affords of the religious doctrine of the period to which it belongs'.<p>Macalister/1949, 157: `A slab...which was dug up in the churchyard some time before 1851...It seems to have been known to Lhuyd, who mentions it in a letter dated 1697'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 148: `Abbey churchyard'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 49: `Formerly standing S. of the church,[1] and more recently re-set in Margam Stones Museum.<p>[1] Stowe MS. 1024, fo. 17; Arch.

The head is filled with a plain free-armed cross[2] of Anglian type, with moulded borders, carved in medium relief. The shaft below is filled with a Latin inscription (Fig. 167).<p>[2] The form of the cross with its widely splayed arms and small circular armpits is characteristic of a group of 10th--11th-century crosses in SW.

J. Williams (Ab Ithel) quotes the following triad from the Myvyrian Archaeology vol ii. p. 15: `The three brave chieftains of the isle of Britain, GRUDNEU and Henbrien and Aedenawg. They would never leave the field of battle except on their biers, and they were the three sons of Gleisiar of the North and Haernwedd Vradawg (treacherous) their mother. These brothers are said to have flourished in the sixth century. My own opinion is that there is nothing in the character of the letters and style of orthography [of the inscription] irreconcilable with that hypothesis, though I doubt whether the form and design of the cross do not point to a later date.' (Arch. Camb. 1851, p. 307.)'</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Latin (rbook)
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 26: `I have been led to suppose the terminal word <em>ahest</em> to represent <em>ejus</em>, as such is a common termination of the formula `pro anima eius' -- as on Samson's cross `pro anmia ejus', on Houelt's cross at Llantwit `pro anima Res pa(tr)es eus', the last word being clearly ejus although misspelt on the stone (Mr. Rhys prints it as correctly written -- Notes, p.9), and on the smaller cross at Merthyr Mawr `pro anima ejus'. Mr. Rhys however suggests, `As to Ahest, which it has been tried to distort into ejus, it is probably the name which occurs as Achess in the <em>Liber Landavensis</em>, where we have Trefbledgwr Mabaches (p. 32) and Audi Filium Achess (p. 265)'.<p>Rhys/1899, 143--144: `In early Medieval Irish z was treated as an equivalent for <em>st</em>, and it is fairly certain that our inscriber would not regard his z as the soft sibilant of such words as <em>zeal</em> or <em>zero</em>, as that sound was unknown in Celtic, whether Goidelic or Brythonic. One of the most remarkable things about this inscription is, that it seems to represent the author of the inscription's pronunciation of Latin phonetically: thus we have <em>inomine</em> for in <em>nómine</em>, and <em>anma</em> for <em>ánima</em>; whence in the same way Modern French <em>âme</em> for Old French <em>anme</em>, Spanish <em>alma</em>. The <em>b</em> in <em></em>proparabit<em> was to be here pronounced </em>v<em> as in </em>Conbelin<em>, and as in Latin from the fourth century down: see such forms as </em>comparabit se biba<em> for </em>comparavit se viva<em> in De Rossi's Christian Inscriptions found in Rome, vol. i, No. 1125. The </em>o<em> in </em>proparabit<em> is of a different origin, being due, no doubt, to confusion of the Latin prefixes </em>prae<em> and </em>pro<em>: it is attested elsewhere in Med. Irish </em>procept<em> `teaching', from the Latin </em>praeceptum<em>; while the related Welsh word was </em>pregeth<em>, originally meaning the act of teaching, but now only a sermon. It may be pointed out that the phonetic writing is quite of a piece with the simple syntax of the inscription: thus, judging from other instances, we have to take by itself </em>In nomine. dei summi crux Christi<em>, or treat it as equivalent to </em>In nomine dei summi incipit crux Christi<em>; and then it should have gone on with </em>quam preparavit Grutne<em>, but such a construction appears to have been too complicated for the Latinity of the author of this legend'.<p>See also Rhys/1905, 63--65.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 148: `For the formula cf. No. 231. [MARG2/1/1]'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 26: `The rudeness of the letters and the incorrect orthography of nearly every one of the words of this inscription will perhaps be considered as a sufficient warrant for my reading the last line `ejus' rather than as the proper name of some other person for the repose of whose soul the cross was erected by Grutne. The letters are rude minuscules, mixed with uncials (such as the Benedictine authors of the `Nouveau Traité de Diplomatique' would have called semiuncial), the d open and rounded with the second part a little inclined to the left at top, the S both f and S shaped, the r with the second part much elongated, the g of the minuscule form with the top cross-stroke long. The letters are irregular in size and position in the lines, and of a ruder character than those on the stone of Brancuf. The omission of the n in the first word In (nomine) appears to have been intended simply to prevent duplication of the letters. The same peculiarity occurs on the great cross at Merthyr Mawr. The word `anima' seems to have been rather troublesome, as we find it not only misspelt here, but on Samson's cross at Llantwit it is written `anmia' (although correctly given by Rhys and Hübner)'.<p>Rhys/1899, 141--143: `As to the next Margam cross, I had only time to look at it hurriedly in 1897, but I felt confident that it had been correctly read. On my visit in 1898, however, I had plenty of leisure to scrutinise it, and to discover, to my surprise, that we have always misread it, especially the fifth line, which has been treated as <em>Critdi</em>...At all events, there is no doubt but that we are to read the beginning of this legend as <em>inomine</em>, and I am inclined to read the end Anest, and to regard that as an earlier form of the woman's name Nest: the perpendicular of the <em>n</em> in Anest is no taller than that of the first <em>n</em> in <em>inomine</em>, but it is straight or perpendicular, while that of the letter in <em>inomine</em> is not really so, as it bends backwards a bit at the top. However, I should not quarrel with anyone who wishes still to read <em>Ahest</em>, provided he does not further try to make it a form of the Latin word <em>eius</em>. The letter which has been read t in the impossible form <em>Critdi</em> = <em>Christi</em> is not a <em>t</em>, but has the shape of a z; but it may be doubted whether it was intended for z rather than for s. Thus we have s and sometimes a reversed s; and on the Clydey stone of Dobituci we have the former made with angles instead of curves, and looking, consequently, like an inverted z, namely, in <em>FILIVS</em>. So our instance here may be a reversed s similarly angulated into the shape of z. But, on the other hand, the inscriber may have intended a z, and in that case he probably congratulated himself on achieving a novelty in the spelling of the word Christi'.<p>See also Rhys/1905, 63--64.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 148, `Round half-uncials, deeply picked in good but careless style, punctuated with single and triple points used as stops'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 49: `The lettering is in crude half-uncials with one square E (l. 8) and common manuscript abbreviations: `inomine' for in nomine (cf Nos. 928, 933), `di' for dei and `sumi' for summi (see p. 27 above). Though there is no spacing of words, two punctuation stops occur, one single and one triple'.</em>
