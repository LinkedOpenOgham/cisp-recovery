<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>non-arch dig, 1904 workmen
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Allen/1905, 70: `The discovery of an inscribed stone at Treflys was first reported to the Editor by Mr. E. Alfred Jones, and the present account has been compiled from the information subsequently received from Mr. T. E. Morris, Local Secretary for Carnarvonshire, and Mr. Harold Hughes, A.R.I.B.A., of Bangor'.<p>Rhys/1907, 92--93: `In October, 1904, I received a letter from Mr. Charles E. Breese, of Portmadoc...I quote the following words from it: `A find of considerable interest has been made near the old church of Treflys, which, you may remember, stands about midway between here and Criccieth, in fairly close proximity to the sea. Some six weeks ago, some workmen engaged in removing on the west of the church the boundary wall enclosing the graveyard on that side, in order to make room for an extension; and at a depth of about 1 ft. 3 ins. or 1 ft. 8 ins. from the surface, and forming part of the foundation of the wall, they came across an inscribed stone. I send you a rubbing which I have taken of it, and also a very rude sketch-plan of the <em>locale</em>'.<p>The inscribed stone was discovered in September last by two workmen, who were employed by the Rev. Canon Lloyd Jones, of Criccieth, to pull down the wall of the churchyard at Treflys for the purpose of extending the area available for burials. The stone was found built into the foundations of the western wall of the churchyard, nearly opposite the western entrance doorway of the church. It has now been placed inside the church'.<p>Macalister/1945, 372, and Nash-Williams/1950, 93, both state that the stone is now against the north wall of the nave.</em>

It no doubt originally stood vertically, the portion at the bottom, which is plain, being buried in the ground to the depth of about 1ft. 6ins. to 2ft'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 93: `Rough pillar stone'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Condition:</strong><td>complete , good<br>Rhys/1907, 93, quoting letter from Mr. Breese: `The stone is perfect, and the incisions upon it in a very excellent state of preservation. The stone is only very slightly chipped at the bottom end'.<p>Macalister/1945, 372, notes that the left hand edge has been chipped, `as though to destroy an Ogham'.  <p>Nash-Williams/1950, 93, states that the damage is `along the...right-hand angle of the face'.</em>

Notes:</strong><td>Allen/1905, 71: `All the letter are capitals except the s at the end of the first name, which is of miniscule shape'.<p>Rhys/1907, 93: `the S is of the tall gamma type; the F has the first I of <em>filius</em> attached to its lower bar, while the <em>lius</em> is represented by a sort of combination, which may be described as r [r = graphic inserted which looks like an upside-down capital L], making an L upside down, to be read as <em>li</em>: then a sort of arm sloping upwards (from the middle of the perpendicular r) towards the right provides a V, while the arm and the lower half of the perpendicular yields an r [S]. Thus I regard the word as meant to be read FILIVr [S], which is the case required'.<p>Macalister/1945, 373: `The FI of FII is ligatured. The engraver omitted the L, and seems also to have left out the S at the end of the first name -- confused perhaps by the similarity of the half-uncial S (r) to F (f). He was able to squeeze the missing S into the narrow space which he had left, but made no attempt to rectify the other omission. A later hand endeavoured to do so by scratching a line, more or less horizontal, running to the middle of the second I of FII. There is no HIC'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 93: `Roman capitals with half-uncial S and horizonatal final -I. The second word is presumably an abbreviation for FILIVS'.</em>

Rhys/1907, 95: `I have nothing to compare for certain with IACONVS unless it be <em>Iacinipoi</em>, in an Ogam inscription now at Donard, Co. Kildare; and probably one must not associate them with Irish <em>ícc</em>, `a healing, salvation', and Welsh <em>iach</em>, `hale, sound, healthy', which seem to have bifurcated from a common stem <em>iecc</em>. The Vendotian prince called <em>Iacob</em>, son of <em>Beli</em>, in the Harleian Geneaologies (<em>Y Cymmrodor</em>, ix, 170), is called by Geoffrey xii, 6, <em>Iago</em>, accusative <em>Iagonem</em>, as if he had found a name <em>Iaco</em>, accusative <em>Iaconem</em>, in a Latin document; nor is it quite impossible that our <em>Iaconus</em> is a form of the Christian name <em>Iacobus</em>; at any rate, it would be almost as near, with its <em>n</em>, to the original as the Italian <em>Giácomo</em>, and the English <em>James</em> with their <em>m</em>.  If, for instance, **** [name in Greek] was imported with its <em>ß</em> pronounced as <em>v</em>, as has long been the case in Greek, there would be nothing strange in <em>Iácovos</em> being made by Goidelic Christians into <em>Iáconus</em>; but, needless to say, this is all conjecture'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#mini>Mini</a> (Language: Incomplete Information; Gender: male)<br>
Rhys/1907, 95--6: `the other name, <em>Mini</em>, it is hard to say whether the inscriber regarded this as the genitive if <em>Minus</em> or of a derivative <em>Minius</em>, as it would do for either. There is an Irish adjective <em>mín,</em> which signifies `soft, smooth, fine, small'; but whether our <em>Mini</em> has anything to do with it it is hard to say. It is more, perhaps, to the point to mention the name of the family or sect called Mocumin, in Adamnan's <em>Life of Columba</em>. It occurs in the names of two brothers, Lugbeus <em>Mocumin</em> and Lugneus <em>Mocumin</em>, where the latter word means <em>Mocu Min</em> or the Kin of Min. Sometimes Adamnan expands the name thus: Lugbeus gente Mocumin, or Lugbeus of the <em>gens</em> called the kin of Min...none of the passages enable one to find out where the Mocumin were settled. But until some evidence of the occurence of the patronymic <em>mac Min</em> is found, I cannot help thinking that <em>filius</em> is here to be interpreted in a wide sense, such as was sometimes given to <em>mac</em> in Irish, and that <em>filius Mini</em> is to be treated as a loose translation into Latin of the Goidelic <em>Mocu- Min</em>.  <em>Mocu</em> is neither declined nor translated by Adamnan, but the Ogam inscriptions of Ireland [are]...almost always in the genitive, <em>mocoi</em> or <em>mucoi</em>. The latter also occurs in this country, at Bridell in Pembrokeshire, and at Silchester, in Hampshire; but nowhere, unfortunately, has this difficult term of Goidelic sociology been found rendered into Latin'.</em>
