<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Forsyth/1996, 192: `Burrian is carved on a very fine scale'. <p>Forsyth notes the presence of a number of unusual characters and<em>forfeda</em>. These are: <p>Character 3: `After a gap there are two short strokes to the right of the stem, sloping forwards. Macalister interpreted these as L without any further comment. The lack of a bind-stroke renders this unlikely but in any case it is clear that the second stroke, at least, continues across the stem. There is a nick at the point where the right distal end of the first stroke would lie, but no evidence of anything between that and the stem. Padel interpreted these as two seperate letters, BM, but was unhappy that they were so cramped. Neither mentions what appears to be a third stroke, sloping in the opposite direction, most obvious to the right of the stem, but continuing across to intersect with the second stroke just to the left of the stem...I think it is unlikely that there is more than a single letter here. That the first stroke is not bound to the second throws it into some doubt, since all the other letters are bound. The third stroke is doubtful, but if accepted could be intended for the first <em>forfid</em> ><. That the two opposing diagonals do not intersect exactly on the stem would be explained as just a careless slip caused by carving the letters first and then adding the stem to join them up...One might speculate that the reason this letter is so indistinct is because it was a botched job deliberately effaced by the carver but really this is clutching at straws'.<p>Character 7: `A single stroke perpendicular across the stem with a bind stroke on the right distal end - a hammer-head A'.<p>Character 10: `Next is a very worn patch out of which emerge the distal ends  of three strokes to the right and three to the left. These slope in the direction of the reading and if produced would meet the stem to form three right-facing arrows...each slightly larger than the previous one. The lack of bind strokes is surprising, but nonetheless this group is probably best interpreted as an angled vowel - U'. <p>Character 16: `One long stroke perpendicularly across the stem intersected by a second lying at an angle of less than 45 degrees to the stem. The perpendicular stroke is deeper than the oblique one. This has been interpreted as the first <em>forfid</em> >< and assigned a value K by Padel. It is, howevere, quite unlike [character] 21 which is formed, not of straight intersecting lines, but of opposed angled  lines which do not quite meet'. <p>Character 21: `Two long angled strokes, opposing, not meeting ><...This same character appears on the Formaston [FRMSN] and Lunnasting [LTING] stones but it is unclear whether it is to be considered a variant of the first <em>forfid</em> or a separate character in its own right'. <p>Character 22: `Cross-hatching - two superimposed sets of five parallel oblique strokes across the stem in opposite directions. This <em>forfid</em> is known from the manuscript tradition and is found in stone at Bressay. It has the value RR [Sims-Williams 1992: 72]. It is unclear if there is any difference in the sound represented by this character as opposed to the more usual pair of Rs, e.g., 5/6, 11/12'. </em>
