Beneath the wheel is a panel bearing a similar key-pattern, and another with the inscription'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 146--148: `<em>Front.</em> The head is filled with a square-armed wheel-cross of Celtic type, with the arms filled with plain six-cord plaits (R.A. 505) interjoined by twists around a small central panel containing a pair of interlinked oval rings (R.A. 766). The arcs of the wheel are filled with irregular triangular frets (Cf. R.A. 926) in variant forms. In the spandrels below the head are single triangular frets. The decoration of the shaft is disposed vertically in panels with moulded borders: (a) regular ten-cord triple-beaded plait;[4] (b) double horizontal panel -- r., two squares of diagonal swastika and triangular frets (R.A. 1007 and 985) superimposed; l., Latin inscription...The cross at the beginning of l. 2 is of Latin form, with splayed arm-ends (cf. No. 222); (c) the angles of the plain butt are decorated with incised right-angled lines or frets. <em>Back.</em> Large incised outline cross (cf. No. 236).<p>[4]The triple-beaded cord is characteristic of Italian interlacing. In Britain plain and double-beaded interlacing are more usual, but the triple-beaded form also occurs in all areas, except, apparently, Scotland. In Ireland triple-beaded interlacing appears to be definitely early; elsewhere, including Wales (cf. Nos. 14, 38, 185, 63-5), it occurs both early and late See CAPCT, p. 246 ; LSI, i, p. 95; ERA, i, p. 66'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 48--49: `The disc-head displays a ringed cross extending to the plain edge-moulding with square arm-ends and hollowed angles, outlined by a narrow moulding; the panelled arcs of the ring are similarly outlined. The inter-arm spaces and those between the ring and the edge-moulding are plain and sunk to emphasise the cross. Each arm-end is filled with plain six-cord plaitwork deriving from paired plaits twisted and linked diagonally at the hub where a lozenge-shaped panel is filled with a knot of two intertwined oval loops. The arcs of the ring contain differing patterns of triangular frets.<p>The shaft has plain rounded angle-mouldings continued below the disc-head by a narrow beading that merges into a horizontal beading returned at the ends as a triangular fret to fill the spandrels. The main panel forming the upper half of the shaft is filled with ten-cord triple-beaded plaitwork in five regular loops, framed by a plain inner moulding that is continued down the shaft parallel to the edge. The right-hand moulding is doubled back short of the foot to frame the lower panels which are divided by a vertical beading into one square panel (on the left) and a pair of smaller panels. Of the latter, the upper panel contains a diagonal swastika key-pattern and the lower a diagonal triangular key-pattern. In the square panel is a Latin inscription...The narrow panel below these panels is plain except for an incised horizontal fret springing from each angle-moulding and doubly returned.     <p>On the opposite face an incised outline Latin cross, 73 cm high, extends almost to the full width and height of the dischead as well as below it'.</em>

The two first n's somewhat resemble the letter h with the first perpendicular longer than the second, and in the case of the first one the two perpendiculars are not perceptibly joined at all, so that they look like ||. Most of these inscriptions are punched, and frequently the punching has been left incomplete, but I have no note that this particular one was done by punching. Lastly, the usual abbreviations for <em>Christi</em> and <em>pro</em> are used on this cross'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 146: `Round half-uncials, lightly picked in fairly good style, with two abbreviations.

In the second line the five minims here read as NNI are not linked, but the spelling of `Euniaun' (later Einion) occurs in several early documents...The small Latin cross before the name Enniaun has wedge-shaped arms'.</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#enniaun>Enniaun</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Rhys/1873, 8: `Enniaun is of course the name which occurs later as Einion'.<p>Rhys/1899, 139: `Who <em>Enniaun</em>, now written <em>Einion</em>, may have been...I cannot say...[It] was a very common name'.<p>Westwood/1879, 29: `The former of these names occurs in the Welsh histories under the name Einion and the latter as Gwrwaret. The former name is recorded in the Pedigrees of the Saints as Einion, king in Lleyn and Seiriol in the upper part of Anglesea, son of Owain Danwyn the son of Einion Yrth, the son of Cunedda Wledig; but the locality militates against the supposition that he was the maker of the cross at Margam'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 48: ``Euniaun' (later Einion) occurs in several early documents'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#guorgoret>Guorgoret</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Rhys/1873, 8: `Guorgoret occurs as Gworgoret in `Brut y Tywysogion'.<p>Rhys/1899, 139--140: `Who <em>Enniaun</em>, now written <em>Einion</em>, may have been, or <em>Guorgoret</em>, now <em>Gwrwared</em>, I cannot say. The former was a very common name, but the other does not appear to have been so. Westwood has found a name <em>Guagorit</em> borne by a lay witness to a charter which was attested also by Samson, Abbot of Llancarvan. The document is cited by Mr. Seebohm in his Tribal System in Wales (pp. 210--11), where one finds the name written Guogoret, which I regard as carelessly so spelled for <em>Guorguoret</em>. The transaction was not only witnessed by him and Samson, Abbot of Llantwit, but it was also in favour of Llancarvan, and the abbot at the time was Conige, which is to be borne in mind.     <p><em>Guogoret</em> may have been our Guorgoret, but his fellow-witness cannot have been the Samson supposed to have left for Brittany about the middle of the sixth century, since our inscription is more likely to belong to the eighth century than to the sixth'.<p>Westwood/1879, 29: `And with reference to the second name upon this cross, Guorgoret, it is to be noticed that a village whose name was Cong<em>uoret</em>, in Pencenli, was granted to the Abbot of St. Cadoc, and the Abbot with his clergy `brought the cross of St. Cadoc and his earth, and going round the aforesaid land of Conguoret claimed it, and before proper witness scattered the earth of the aforesaid saint thereon in token of perpetual possession'. Amongst the witnesses to this grant were Samson Abbot of the Altar of Saint Illtyd, and <em>Guaguorit</em>'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 48--49: `In the Llancarfan charters `Guoguoret' occurs as the name of a witness.[2]<p>[2] Vita S. Cadoci, c. 55 in Vitae Sanct., p. 126'.</em>
