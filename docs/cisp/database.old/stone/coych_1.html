The angle-mouldings were originally decorated with plain plaitwork, though only one retains any trace of this; the upper edges have traces of ring-and-pellet decoration. The panel on the E. face has a defaced inscription at the head (see below), separated by a narrow band of irregular plain knotwork from a distorted triangular key-pattern forming two pairs of crosses (much weathered, but hardly a swastika key-pattern); the lower border is formed of a double plain moulding. On the S. side in a vertical panel is a double looped knot separated by a moulded border from the pattern of irregular knotwork, the lower half much decayed. On the W. side the panel and angle-mouldings are so weathered as to leave only traces of irregular knotwork at the top of the panel. In the narrow vertical panel on the N. side a looped knot and a pattern of irregular knotwork below a moulded border fill the upper half, the remainder of the panel being weathered'.</em>

Rhys/1899, 164--166: `In noticing the Samson cross we came across the name Ebissar before, but I was then unable to throw any light on it; and now that I think I understand it, I am ashamed to say that I had been put off the scent, so to say, by a single letter in the spelling, namely, the <em>b</em>. This, as already mentioned, had to do duty both for <em>b</em> and <em>v</em>; and standing as it does here flanked by vowels, the sound it represents is that of <em>v</em>; but the consonants which are, when vowel-flanked, reduced to <em>v</em> are <em>b</em> and <em>m</em>. If, however, we suppose <em>b</em> to be here the original consonant, we get no forwarder; but if we regard it as <em>m</em> we arrive at a form <em>Emissar</em>, which is at once seen to have been borrowed from the Latin word <em>emissarius</em>, `an emissary or spy'. This was used in the first instance, doubtless, to translate the Goidelic <em>Scitlivisse</em> as a proper name, so that we have the meaning of that vocable practically settled for us by the unexpected means of this name Ebissar. But to come back to the spelling with <em>b</em> in the three instances of this name, the question naturally suggests itself, why it was not written with <em>v</em>? The answer is probably that <em>v</em>, or rather <em>u</em> as it is written, was wanted for the vowel <em>u</em> -- in Welsh for the two vowels <em>u</em> and <em>ü</em>---and also for the semi-vowel <em>u</em> or <em>w</em>, certainly in Brythonic, and possibly in Goidelic too. So <em>b</em> was retained to express the two sounds of <em>b</em> and <em>v</em>, as it had done in the Latin from which the alphabet had been borrowed. That being so, when an <em>m</em> was softened into <em>v</em>, there was no choice but to write it <em>b</em>, if one wished to represent the sound in the least ambiguous way; and so <em>Emissar</em>, mutated <em>Evissar</em>, comes to be written <em>Ebissar</em>. This is, however, not the orthography of the earliest Irish and Welsh glosses, of the ninth and eighth centuries, if there be any which can be dated as early as the eighth century. In the case of vowel-flanked <em>g</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>b</em>, the glosses did not usually distinguish between the mutes so written and the corresponding voiced spirants, and, very possibly, the example was set by the case of <em>b</em> being either pronounced <em>b</em> or <em>v</em> in late Latin, which the reader had to decide for himself; and similarly in the case of <em>g</em> and <em>d</em>, where he had to distinguish between <em>g</em> and <em>gh</em>, and between <em>d</em> and <em>dh</em>. This was extended to <em>m</em>, which was thus made to cover both <em>m</em>, and <em>v</em> derived from <em>m</em> by the usual reduction of the latter consonant when flanked by vowels. There may have been a reason why this <em>v</em> (from <em>m</em>) did not continue to be represented by <em>b</em>, for, in Goidelic dialects at any rate, a <em>v</em> derived from <em>m</em> is accompanied by nasalisation, absent in the case of <em>v</em> from <em>b</em>, and it is possible that the same was at one time the case in Brythonic. On the whole, however, the analogy of <em>g</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>b</em> would seem enough to account for <em>m</em> acquiring the value of <em>m</em> and <em>v</em>. There is another consideration not to be overlooked: when the language began to soften intervocalic <em>g</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>m</em>, it must have been held a slovenly pronunciation which probably was not regarded as deserving of being indicated in writing; so that the old spelling was continued with the new pronunciation, and all the more readily as the use made of the letter <em>b</em> showed the way to conceal the new pronunciation by means of the old orthography. The double use of the letters <em>g</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>m</em> continued in Welsh till the influence of the Normans revolutionised writing and spelling in Wales; in Ireland it continued for centuries later. It led to a certain amount of confusion between <em>b</em> and <em>m</em>, as, for instance, in the case of trem, in Welsh, for treb, pronounced trev or tref, `town, -ton or homestead'; but this need not delay us here on our way to a chronological conclusion, which is this: the use of <em>g</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>m</em>, each with double power, continued unbroken for centuries after it was once established as shown in the ancient glosses; therefore, the use of <em>b</em> (for <em>v</em> derived from <em>m</em>), as in <em>Ebissar</em> and <em>Conbelani,</em> dates probably anterior to the glosses, that is to say, before the ninth century'.<p>Macalister/1949, 155: `The three occurences of the name Ebissar---two here and one at Llantwit---most likely all refer to one man, who was presumably an ecclesiastic or a wealthy and benevolent layman in the locality'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 130: `The name occurs again on Nos. 94 (? the same person) and 222'.</em>
