<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Macalister/1945, 108--109: `Windele, and following him Brash, state that this monument formed part of a `stone circle' gradually removed by the local peasants for building purposes. If this be correct, we must conclude that the circle was already in existence, and the inscription intruded upon one of the stones. There is reason to suspect such intrusions in the case of certain single standing pillar-stones, but there is no precedent for it in the case of a stone forming part of a composite megalithic monument. This particular stone was appropriated as a lintel for a pig-stye, where it was discovered by Crocker and Abell: removed in 1835 to the Royal Cork Institution, it is now in University College Cork'.<p>Power et al/1997, 167: `Removed by antiquarian John Windele to collection of Royal Cork Institution having served time `as a lintel for the door of a pig-stye' (Windele 1849--51, 143); now in the collection of UCC. According to Windele's source, stone formed part of a stone circle in `Glenn-na-g-cloch' which `was not standing when I visited the place' (<em>ibid</em>.). No other record of a stone circle in Glenaglogh North of South; Hartnett (PJH) thought Windele's description `near the eastern foot of Muskerry Mountain' (<em>ibid.</em>) might locate site in former townland'.</em>

He must have begun at the top and worked downward, tiring of the task when he had reached 1S.  In this letter he has not re-worked the distal end of the second score, so that its fine tip remains to betray the hand of the meddler. Probably the same person, misled by some irregularity on the surface, interjected a meaningless U between the two words. The word MAQI was completed on the second angle of the broad face: the distal ends of the Q can be traced, 1' 3" down from the top of the stone. The rest of the inscription is fractured away: the disposition of the flake-scars suggests a following MUCOI, introducing an irrecoverable word, which ended about 3' 6" above the supporting block'.</em>
