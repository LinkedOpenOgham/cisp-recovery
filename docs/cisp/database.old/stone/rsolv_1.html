<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Westwood/1865, 65--66: `It is now (or at least was in 1846) standing in the yard of the house of the resident manager of the colliery on the tramway at Bryn Cefneithan, about three miles to the east of Neath...having been removed from a small holy-well in the vicinity'.<p>Rhys/1873, 8: `From Loughor we went to Neath, and there inspected a stone which now stands in Miss Parson's garden'.<p>Westwood/1879, 26--27: `The carved and inscribed stone represented in this figure was brought before the public notice of archaeologists by myself in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1865, p. 65, at which time it was used as a pump-stone in the yard of the house of the manager of the colliery on the tramway at Bryn Keffneithan, about three miles to the east of Neath. It had formerly stood at Resolven, and had been removed from a small holy-well in the vicinity. It has again been removed, and is now in the garden of Miss Parsons at Neath. Surely it ought to be deposited either in a church, or some public museum or other public building'.<p>Macalister/1949, 164: `Found at a holy well at Resolven; afterwards in the house of the manager of a colliery at Bryn Cyfneithan, where, according to Westwood, it was used as a `pumpstone,' whatever that may be. Then it sojourned for while in the garden of a Miss Parsons at Neath. At last it has found a resting-place in the National Museum of Wales'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 55: `First recorded in 1846 as `having been removed from a small holy-well'...it was subsequently moved to Neath, but is now in the National Museum of Wales'.</em>

The borders of the upper and lower arm-ends are splayed and decorated with three pairs of incised rings symmetrically disposed. The shaft below is filled with a moulded vertical panel containing a Latin inscription'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 55: `The rounded head on the one decorated face 57cm wide is filled with an equal armed-cross ringed cross in which the interarm spaces form panels outlined by the raised edges of the arms and arcs of the ring, all framed by a double edge-moulding. At the intersection is a small moulded ringed pellet, and the moulded edges of the cross incorporate paired pellets in false relief, one pair at the top and two at the lower edge.<p>The shaft forms a single panel framed by a continuation of the outer angle-mouldings of the head doubled by an inner moulding and is filled with an inscription'.</em>
