<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Okasha/1993, 68: `C.G. Henderson, writing probably between 1912 and 1914, reported that the stone was then 'On the lawn at Boskenna'. It has been in Boskeena garden since then. Henderson added that it had been 'acidently [sic] found by the Late Canon Martyn of Buryan'; Canon Martyn was rector of St Buryan from 1882 to 1913. When found, the stone was 'doing duty as a gatepost at Vellansajer'. Thomas/1994, 271: `The inscribed stone found at Vellansajer, St Buryan now lies below shrubs in a private garden; use as a gatepost, an outhouse lintel and the mount for a small cannon has not improved it'.<p>ajor.'
