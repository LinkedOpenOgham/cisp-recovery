<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 121--28 `Le Grand knew of four inscriptions in the vicinity of Plourin -- three within the parish and a fourth in the neighbouring parish of Landunvez [LDVEZ/1] -- all of which he thought had been erected soon after the arrival of St Budoc. He stated that the stones were still standing in his day and illustrated each one with an engraving after a sketch made by the local <em>seigneur</em>, the Baron de Kergroadès.<p>There is an independent check on the accuracy of the engravings reproduced by Le Grand: in the original manuscript version of Dom Le Pelletier's <em>Dictionnaire de la langue bretonne</em> there are autograph sketches of two early inscriptions, one of which had previously been drawn by Kergroadès ... By then [1712], however, only one [PLOIN/3] was still in place, the others having already disappeared. ... More than a century later Le Menn published first Le Pelletier's account and then Le Grand's. Le Menn reproduced and transcribed the relevant texts and illustrations. … Le Grand describes the second of the Plourin stones as being built into the fabric of the parish church: "above the first pillar which one encounters on the right side of the entrance to the church, above the door on which are the arms of the lords of Kergroadès". By the time Le Pelletier visited at the beginning of the 18th century this stone had been knocked down (<em>renverser</em>) and taken elsewhere, although he recorded that a priest of the church assured him that he had seen and read it. Thinking that the stone might have been taken to the Kergroadès château, Le Pelletier searched for it there, but found nothing'.<p>(LeMenn/1981a, Le Menn/1981b).<p>The site was visited by members of the CISP team in May 1997 and October 1998.</em>

If they are all taken as capitals, then the only letter of any distinction is N, with an oblique stroke which joins the ascenders medially; this indicates little more than a probability that the inscription is post-Roman. If the 2nd and 3rd letters were to be read as an `OC' A rather than as OC, then this would indicate the use of Insular script, a possibility supported by the drawing of a wedge-shaped finial on the L. However, if, as seems more likely, there is no `OC' A, then the date of production could be anywhere within the 5th- to 12th-century period. The Chi-Rho monogram, if that is what it is, simply indicates Christianity, and little can depend on the form seen on the drawing'.</em>

Davies et al/2000: `IOCILIN `Josselin' is not a native Brittonic name in origin (Fleuriot/1964a, 390). The name form would suggest a later rather than an earlier date; pre-1060 forms of the name Josselin in the Cartulaire de Redon, for example, read Goscelinus; forms in Joscelinus/Josselinus appear in the late 11th century; and in the 12th century the form Joscelinus predominates (CR nos. 310, 311, 390, 391). The use of c for a variety of the sound /s/ suggests that the inscription is later than Old Breton and shows the influence of French spelling. This became common within the Middle Breton period, c. 1100-c. 1650 (Jackson/1967: 825-7). It is just possible, though much less likely, that the inscription is a poor spelling of Old Breton Joscelin with the s omitted'.</em>
