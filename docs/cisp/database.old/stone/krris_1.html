<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Thomas/unpub/1997: `Line one has six symbols; line 2, twelve. All are Roman capitals, but 8 of 18 -- nearly a half -- are of aberrant form...A is normal, low bar (i.e., neither [bar-less A] not `angle-bar'). C is normal and rounded. I (thrice) is normal and deeply cut.  Letters 1 and 13 appear to be a ligature, if so of V and M (normal or inverted); the nearest match would be N Wales, the Porius stone ([Macalister/1945] 420 = ECMW 289), which shows [figure] for t<em>umu</em>lo, but there are heavy objections here to reading `UM', `MU', or `UMU', and I suggest that the letter is meant to be M. S occurs twice, inverted.  No. 15 is letter L, both inverted and reversed; no.17 is V inverted. No.9 is a normal R; provisionally, I suggest that no.5 is an inverted R. Letter no. 6 cannot at the moment be safely read...Line two is apparently a name in (masc.) nom., Latin O-stem as <em>-us</em>; one would assume of the person commemorated. The context for line 1 could then be: some kind of praenomen, also nom. (most unlikely) -- parental name in gen. (`Of-A, B [lies here]'); or the same with an extreme FILI ligature (`Of-A, of the son: B [lies here]').  This depends on letter 6, which is the least easy to make out and may be slightly damaged; no trace of any further letter exists. I cannot make out anything really convincing in the ligatures of FILI, like F/I or F/L/I. Conversely, if this represents some form of capital E, it might be a (fem.) gen. A-stem, as -E (for -AE)'.</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#macar>Macar[.]</a> (Language: Latin; Gender: unknown)<br>
Thomas/unpub/1997: `A name beginning UMACA- or MUACA- or UNUACA- etc., would be so improbable for anything in British `inscriptional Old Celtic' as to be dismissed at once. MACA... is another matter. Cf. the attested 470, N. Cornwall MACARI (misread by Macalister as MAGARI: the -C- is however clear and certain), or (Wales, Glams.) 403 = ECMW 268 with MACARITINI (6th cent.) to be read as MACARI masc.gen + TINI, some adjectival element. Both are Latin MACARIUS, from Greek <em>Makarios</em>; various `Makarios' men were noted Desert Fathers and the currency of the name here will be, almost certainly, from Rufinus's <em>Historia</em>, circulating in Wales from c.450 (from Gaul).<p>This must at least allow the chance that the imperfectly formed letter 5, <em>contra</em> the normal R as letter 9, is an inverted R, giving MACAR.. If this is a `parental, Of-A[, letter 6 ought then to contain, next, I -- perhaps represented by the vertical -- ligatured, but with what? The Greek abstract n. makaria `bliss, happiness' seems unlikely to have given rise to a British Late or V Lat fem. name <em>**Macara</em> gen.<em>-e</em>. I would, on balance, think that a reading M A C A R-inverted I-ligatured + ? is less improbable'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#carasimilius>Carasimilius</a> (Language: Incomplete Information; Gender: male)<br>
Thomas/unpub/1997: `Carasimilius seems legible and extant. How this is to be analysed in another matter. For CARAS one can think of a late form, with unusual vowel-change or written reflex, of CARAUSI(us), emperor 286--93, which did survive in Britain: cf. (Wales, 5th century.) 393 CARAVSIVS HIC IACIT. For the latter part, there is always Rom (A)emilius; inferentially attested for post-400 Cornwall if the pre-Norman <em>*Dimelihoc</em>, now a rich farm called `Domellick' on the S slope of St Dennis with its hillfort containing parish church, is <em>*din</em> plus <em>*Emiliauc</em> from <em>*Aemiliac</em> (<em>-o, -um</em>) `estate of A'. On the other hand the combination has no parallel. Nor do we know if this has first element from Roman nomenclature, or British <em>car-</em> (= amo, amare), or some other root. It may just have to be taken as yet another unattested, but presumably native name. If one applies the usual inferences to reconstruct a contemporary <em>spoken</em> version, one would end up with /k a r ai v~ a l/ or the like, which suggests nothing from any subsequent source'.</em>
