<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 195, `The inscription was brought to public attention in 1988 when Gildas Bernier published an account of it, with a photograph showing the stone in its current position in use as a sundial in the garden of the presbytery in Guer. Bernier does not mention how he came to know of it (it is not included in his 1982 publication) nor does he provide any information concerning its discovery or subsequent history. The stone's current location is clearly secondary but enquiries made locally in 1997 and 1999 could throw no light on when it had been brought to the presbytery nor whence it had come. The sundial on top of the stone is inscribed with the date 1867 but the plate need not have been made for the stone, particularly since the metalwork is resting on top of it and is not attached.<p>The site was visited by members of the CISP team in May 1997, September 1998, and June 1999'.</em>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 198, `The lettering is largely in capitals, although the H, the four Ts, the F, and the S are in half-uncial. Amongst the capitals there is a rounded A and both a rounded and an angular E. There are two types of R, the first with a horizontal foot with a closed bow and the second with an open bow and an angled foot; this second R also has a contraction mark above it. The initial F of the second line has upward slanting cross strokes. The L on the second line has only a short 'foot', but does have an extension to the left from the top of the ascender, as seen in the inscription from Plourin [PLOIN/3], and elsewhere. All the Is are vertical, while the first I of <em>iacit</em> is almost tucked within the preceding C. Of the half-uncial letters the S is standard, while the H has a short leftward extension from the top of the ascender. The Ts all have the ascender curving to the right and down into a bottom stroke. The final T of the first line may have a similar curve from the left-hand end of the top stroke, while the top-stroke of the T in the second line has a bifid terminal at its left-hand end. The second F in the second line, presumably carved by mistake for a B, has a curved top stroke and an unconnected middle bar, making it a typically Insular form.<p>The horizontal-bar R is characteristically British and is not known in France outside Brittany, although it is common on western British inscriptions. The debt to Insular habits is made even more explicit by the vertical lay-out of the letters. The script is difficult to date, but the mixture of capitals and half-uncials, and the relatively plain style of lettering, make a date of carving at some time in the 6th century seem likely'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Legibility:</strong><td>some<br>Davies et al/2000, 197, `The beginning of the inscription is partially obscured by soil and vegetation but excavation to a depth of c.16cm confirmed that the T and the F are the first letters of each line and there is no further lettering below ground level.<p>The carving is reasonably well preserved for a distance of about 15cm. Then there is the patch of wear, which has removed a number of letters (perhaps four from line 1 and more from line 2). Part of the 4th letter of line 1 survives, and could be C or a descender; so also the descender of the 5th letter of line 2 is visible, perhaps E or L, but it is fragmented. However, one letter from line 2 (V) lies within the area of lamination but is clearly visible. The letters are well preserved after the lamination'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 198--99, `TEC[.][--]TI. The first three letters could be Brittonic <em>tec</em> `fair' (Mod. Welsh <em>teg</em>). As a common adjective, <em>tec</em>, <em>teg</em> is well attested in Welsh and Cornish, but the form does not seem to occur in Breton. <em>Tec</em> is probably also related to OIr. <em>toich</em> `fitting, suitable'. Tec- is found as the first element of the OW masculine name <em>Tecguaret</em>. The same name occurs later spelled <em>Tegwared</em> and is, like <em>Tegwyn</em>, a common masculine name. The final <em>-ti</em> implies the Latinization of a masculine name. The amount of space between the <em>c</em> and the <em>t</em> excludes the reading <em>Teciti</em>, as a Latin genitive of the native borrowing of <em>Tacitus</em>, OW <em>Tacit</em>, later <em>Tegid</em>.<p>Another Brittonic possibility for the form <em>Tec[...]ti</em> is a `hypocoristic' or pet-name beginning with <em>To-</em> `thy', such as the form <em>T'eliau</em> from <em>*To-+Eliau(os)</em> based on <em>El-iud</em>. <em>To-</em> names were common amongst Breton, Cornish, and Welsh saints of the migration period, which might suit the cultural <em>milieu</em> of the priest's son here. If the names are Brittonic (which cannot be certain, given the text's fragmentary state), the Latinized endings would be consistent with a 5th- to 7th-century dating.<p>This appears to be another example of an inscription with the father's name in the nominative rather than the expected genitive, as at Louannec [LOUAN/1]'.</em>
