Six months after that, in February 1996, another three dug graves and a further slate-lined grave were revealed; some Roman-period <em>tegulae</em> were found in the neighbourhood of the burials. The left-hand panel of grave S3, the southernmost of the three graves found in parcel no. 147 in 1994, south of the garage, bore an inscription, which was revealed when the panel was washed [Meuret/1998: 85--89].<p>The stone was examined by members of the CISP team in May 1997 and June 1999, and the site was visited at the latter date.'</em>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 286: `This tiny inscription is in capitals. The legs of the up-side-down M are quite widely spread, the final stroke thereby giving the E with which it is ligatured a decided lean to the right. The L has an oblique 'foot' much like that seen at Bais [BAIS/1]. This is a common early medieval letter form, as is the final angle-bar A. The I after the L is vertical, and the T has a very short ascender. It is not possible to be overly specific about the dating of this inscription, but a date from the second half of the 5th century, to the early 7th century, seems likely.<p>Bischoff states that the letter form W did not begin to be used until the 11th century, the form VV being used before this. It is therefore much more likely that the initial letter is an up-side-down M than a W. An up-side-down M occurs on an inscription from Castle Dore in Cornwall, and another on a 5th-century inscription from Tarragona; the latter was immediately corrected by an M the right way up [CDORE/1].</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#melita>Melita</a> (Language: Latin; Gender: female)<br>
Davies et al/2000, 286--88: `The name could be Celtic or Latin in origin (the latter ultimately from Greek). A fortuitous convergence (of cognate Indo-European names) in the provincial Roman world is not unlikely. <em>Meli</em> and <em>Melitus</em> are known from Britain, on inscriptions of suggested 5th- or 6th-century date [Nash-Williams/1950, nos. 92 & 399, 86]. Greek <em>Melite</em> was probably the name of a pagan priestess in Lydia in the 4th century AD. Ellis Evans cites a number of forms from Gaul with an element or elements <em>melis(s)o-</em>, <em>meliððo-</em>, <em>meli-</em>, and <em>melo-</em>. He relates these to Breton, Cornish, and Welsh <em>mel</em> 'honey'; Welsh <em>melys</em>, Irish <em>milis</em> 'sweet'; Greek <em>méli</em>, genitive <em>mélitos</em> 'honey'. The OB name <em>Uuiu-milis</em> may belong to this root. <em>Melite</em> and <em>Melita</em> are probably the same name, but may have come down through different Indo-European dialects, i.e. Greek and Celtic, respectively. Apart from the gender, Late Romano-British <em>Melitus</em> is also very closely comparable. The old stem was <em>*melit-</em>, as seen in the Greek genitive.<p>With double <em>-ll-</em>, the name <em>Mellita</em> is known from France, from the Mâcon, in the 6th century, and from northern Italy in the late 6th century, and <em>(M)ellita</em> for a 5th-century noblewoman in Rome. <em>Mellitus</em>, who was sent to Britain from Rome by Gregory the Great in AD 601 and became the first Bishop of London and third Archbishop of Canterbury (dying in 624), appears in Welsh as <em>Melyd</em>; cf. men called <em>Mellito</em> named on inscriptions from France and Rome. <em>Melyd</em> probably reflects assimilation to the same masculine native name that earlier was written <em>Melitus</em> [Nash-Williams/1950, no. 86], discussed above. At any rate, the Brittonic sensibility was that such a name should have a single <em>-l-</em>, as in the present inscription. The forms with <em>-ll-</em> seem to be Latin and may not be related. <p>Viewing <em>Melita</em> as a possibly Brittonic name (though it could alternatively be Gallo-Latin or a loan from Greek), the spelling would be consistent with a 5th- or 6th-century date. If the final syllable is purely a Latinization, it could be later as well, i.e. an Early Old Breton <em>Melit</em> (= Welsh <em>Melyd</em>) + Latin nominative <em>-a</em>. In either case, <em>Melita</em> is probably feminine, notwithstanding Meuret, who, quoting Favreau, believed it need not be. Rejecting the reading <em>Welita</em>, as explained above, this name can have nothing to do with the ogham genitive VELITAS 'of the poet' (OIr. <em>filed</em>); that last name is indeed masculine, but the Goidelic masculine genitive <em>-as</em> (later <em>-a</em>) did not occur as such in Brittonic or Latin.'</em>
