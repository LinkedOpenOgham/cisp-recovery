On 2R1 there is a D, which both Rhys and I have taken for the first two scores of a second Q; after which the H surface is again spalled away, and nothing is left for a space which would hold about 20 scores (or 12 if we are to read MAQQI). The G shown in my first reading between the two </em>N<em>'s at the end of </em>VURUDDRANN<em> must be deleted. The name ended BAGNI or TAGNI (the I being on the top of the stone now absorbed by the </em>I<em> of </em>MAQI<em>): the B of the first reading is represented by a rather straggling scratch, the less probable T by three notches in the edge of the spall, which may be the distal ends of the scores of the letter.
