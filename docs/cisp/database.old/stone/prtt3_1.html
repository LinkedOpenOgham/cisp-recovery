On the other hand, the cross is of a simple and primitive type, which would incline me to date it early among slabs using the more cursive or minuscular character. A very similar cross is to be seen on the small slab commemorating Abbot Snedriaghail of Clonmacnois, who died in 781 A.D.. This inclines me to date the stone to about the middle of the eighth century, and in the present condition of knowledge that is as near as we can get'.</em><br><strong>600 - 899</strong> (Nash-Williams/1950)<br><br><strong>700 - 899</strong> (RCAHMW/1976)<br>

<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Nash-Williams/1950, 163: `XPI is derived from the early Greek abbreviation for the name of Christ (cf. No. 125). This is the earliest instance of the use of the formula Crux Christi, which characterizes a small but distinctive group of Glamorganshire cross-slabs (cf. Nos. 211, 261) and appears also on certain of the Glamorganshire crosses (Nos. 231, 233). The formula is Irish,[1] possibly with Merovingian or even earlier (? N. African) antecedents.[2]<p>[1] Cf. RSMI, pp. 81, 83, 84. It also occurs in the I. of Man (MC, pp. 112, 122 [Kermode/1907]).<p>[2] Cf. IGG [LeBlant/1865], ii, pl. 85 (No. 506); NR [LeBlant/1892], pp. 3, 211'.</em>
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Paleo. Notes:</strong><td>Richards/1925, 426--427: `Horizontally we have CRUX XPI, and vertically `Gelugui | n'. The lettering bears a striking remsemblance to that of the `Enniaun' Cross at Margam, which is the only other stone in the district bearing the CHI RHO. In the latter case, however, there is the sign of contraction over the `P'; this is missing in the `Geluguin' stone.<p>A photograph and rubbing of the stone were submitted to Dr. Macalister [who states] `the text presents some curious features. The first thing that calls for notice is the combination of vertical and horizontal lines of writing. This is very rare; the nearest parallel that I can recall is one of the Penmachno stones, but that belongs to a different class, as it is written in Roman capitals. The second noteworthy thing is the solitary `N' forming a second line all to itself in the <em>vertical</em> part of the inscription.<p>These two points suggest to me that the stone is of the nature of a palimpsest. I take it that originally it bore nothing more than the cross and the words `CRUX XPI'.  At this stage the stone was identical in type with the slab at Llangyfelach, which also bears a cross and nothing more than the same words `CRUX XPI'; but the cross in the latter example is more ornate, and evidently later than the very simple and primitive Port Talbot example. These crosses are to be considered rather as devotional than as commemorative...By some accident, I take it, the Port Talbot stone was broken, after which it was re-appropriated for the purpose of commemorating the person named on the other inscription. That is my explanation of the change in the direction of the lines; had the two inscriptions been contemporary I feel sure that they would have been written in parallel lines.[1] I am inclined to think that we have the whole of the second inscription, and that it was intended to read GELUGUIN. Had the line of writing been much longer, we should have expected the superfluous `n' to have been written, for the convenience of the reader, under the <em>last</em> rather than under the first letter.  Moreover, the proportions of the surviving part of the cross suggest that there is not a very great length of the stem lost, and as the cross would most likely occupy as much as possible of the space available, I do not suppose that the slab was ever very large, or that there was room upon it for many more letters -- not enough to make another word. Impressions are, of course, very fallacious, but certainly I derive from the photograph an impression of an inscription that has just fitted into the space which the present size of the stone allows''.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 163: `Round half-uncials, coarsely picked in good style. Some of the letters are lightly clubbed'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 42: `rounded half-uncials'.</em>

Richards/1925, 428: `GELUGUIN, if (as I suppose) that is the entire inscription, can be nothing but a name. The great Celtic Onomasticon that will be somebody's life-work has not yet come into being, so that we are still obliged to hunt down names in a multiplicity of indexes appended to editions of separate texts. GELUGUIN is certainly new to epigraphy'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 42: `GELUGUI[ / N... probably incomplete, word presumably names the person commemorated as on comparable Irish slabs (but cf No. 886)'.</em>
