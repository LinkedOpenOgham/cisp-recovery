<tr valign=top> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>first mentioned, 1868 Bannister, J.
<tr valign=top> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Macalister/1945, 462--464: `A rubbing of this stone was exhibited at a meeting of the Royal Institute of Cornwall, 30 November 1868, when the following remarks were made upon it, contained in a letter from Rev. Dr. Bannister, St. Day, Scorrier:--<p>`As far as I am aware, this stone has never before been noticed...The rubbing is not a good one, as materials were not of first-rate order'.<p>This rubbing seems to be referred to in a letter written by the Rev. W Iago to Sir Samuel Ferguson, dated 8 December 1874, and at present in my hands...`In order to follow up these unsatisfactory data, I paid a visit to Tresco Island on 9 July 1929. I found, however, that the floor of the meagre remains of the Abbey was covered with earth; an enquiry of the head gardener of the demesne in which it stands, elicited nothing beyond the fact that the existence of the stone was then completely unknown. But the publication of my notes in AC (1929: 191) led to the satisfactory result of inaugurating a search for the missing stone by Major Dorrien-Smith, proprietor of the island; and in 1937 he discovered it'.<p>Okasha/1993, 304, summarises the above and states: `The stone has remained in the same position since 1869'.</em>

It is set flat into the ground beneath a doorway, just west of the only surviving large archway. One end of the stone is built under the eastern jamb of the doorway'.<p>Thomas/1994, 271: `The stone from the Isles of Scilly forms part of an archway paving at the ruined St Nicholas Priory church in Tresco Abbey gardens'.</em>

There is, therefore, no hope of completing the inscription'.<p>Thomas/1985a, 178: `it was broken long ago and part of its inscription thereby lost'.</em>

Alternatively, the horizontal `I' may be a flaw in the stone and the vertical line below read as I. The first legible letter is probably H, but N is also a possible reading...The penultimate letter seems to me, however, to be clearly B'.<p>Thomas/1994, 271: `A new and very careful attempt (Fig. 16.10), a last-chance effort, was made in 1990 and though any reading is now inconclusive it might be...THI FILI and (lower line)...COL{I}NI (Fig.) [sic].
