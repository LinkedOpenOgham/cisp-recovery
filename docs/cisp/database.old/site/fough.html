<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Westwood/1858, 162: `...an ox-stall or beast-house on the west side of the road from Brecon to Merthyr, about 100 yards north from the thirteenth mile-stone from the former place.  The adjoining farm-house abuts on the turnpike road, on the south side of a small rivulet, and a long barn and cow-house adjoining are on the north side of a small brook which crosses the road'.</em>
<p>Rhys/Wilkins/1886, 93--4: `...a beast-house at Abercar farm, on the Brecon road, six miles from Merthyr...There are remains of a building near Abercar farm, which is said by tradition to have been a chapel.  No examination of the heap of stones seems to have been made'.</em>
<p>Rhys/Wilkins/1886, 96: `The other stone is important [ABCAR/2], as seeming to prove that the burial-place to which both it and the other [ABCAR/1] belonged was at Abercar'.</em>
<p>A `beast house' on the road from Brecon to Merthyr Tydfil (Nash-Williams/1950, 69).</em>
