<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Hemp/Gresham/1961, 154-155: `  The [find] spot is 400 yds. west-north-west of the farmhouse, and 120 yds. north-east from Bench Mark 673.3...this is about 200 yds. south of the left bank of the Afon Prysor, a short distance above Pont Trawsfynydd, and must be close to the line of the Roman road, which probably crossed the river  not far away... </em>
<p>`The find spot of this stone, near the banks of the Afon Prysor, makes it reasonable to assume that the inscription originally marked a grave placed beside the Roman road, which leads southwards from the fort at Tomen y mur, 2 1/2 miles distant, to cross the river somewhere close at hand.  No certain traces of the road are now visible on either bank to locate the crossing exactly, although the words <em>Sarn Helen</em> were formerly marked on the 6-in. Ordnance Survey map at a point 150 yds. north-east of the find-spot...Close beside the same road, 2 1/2 miles along its course from Bryn Goleu to the south-south-east, formerly stood the well-known Porius Stone, now at Cardiff'.</em>
