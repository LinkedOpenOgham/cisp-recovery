<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Fanning/1981, 68--70: `Reask lies about eight miles north-west of the town of Dingle and three-quartes of a mile east of the village of Ballyferriter in the heart of the Gaeltacht of Corkaguiney. The site is located on roughly the highest point (O.D. 64.45) of this rather low-lying townland. To the north one can see the entire expanse of Smerwick Harbour with Mount Brandon to the north-eat. On the west the shoulder of Cruaghmarhin rises steeply and on the south and east the mountains of Lateeve and Reenconnell complete the crescent which almost encloses the lowlands stretching down to the sea...Nothing is known of the history of the site at Reask and indeed very little, if anything, is recorded in the native annals or in later documentation of these early christian enclosures'.</em>
<p>Fanning/1981, 67--68: `Excavations at the site were carried out by the Office of public works during 1972-75 and revealed a sequence of burials and habitation structures dating from about the fifth century A.D. to medieval times and later. The roughly oval-shaped area was shown to have been enclosed by a substantial cashel-type wall now partly obscured by later field fences. ...Underlying the oratory in the eastern sector is the primary lintel grave cemetery with a small slab-shrine close by. The assemblage of finds includes a number of early cross-inscribed slabs, a range of stone artifacts, glass beads, coarse pottery, and some sherds of Roman-type amphorae. There is also evidence for primitive iron working - furnace pits, slag, tuyeres and other vitreous waste...A small corn-drying kiln was discovered outside the enclosure in the south-west sector. A charcoal sample from the hearth associated with the primary levels gave a radio-carbon determination of B.P. 1565 +- 90 (385 +- 90 A.D.).'</em>
