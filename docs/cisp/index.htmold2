Celtic Inscribed Stones Project (CISP)</H2>
The Project (CISP) is a joint project of the Department of History and
the Institute of Archaeology under the direction of Prof. Wendy Davies
in collaboration with Prof. James Graham-Campbell. The project is funded
by the Humanities Research Board (now the Arts and Humanities Research
Board).&nbsp; The project currently employs three full time <A HREF="#mark">research
fellows</A>: Kris Lockyear, Mark Handley and Paul Kershaw.

<P>CISP is undertaking a collaborative, interdisciplinary study of Medieval
Celtic inscriptions. One of its main objectives is the compilation of an
accessible, comprehensive and authoritative <A HREF="database">database</A>
of all known inscriptions. By bringing this material together in one place
and making it readily available our goal is to turn what is a largely untapped
resource into usable material.&nbsp; Additionally, field work has been
undertaken by Katherine Forsyth (former Research Fellow), Kris Lockyear
and Wendy Davies on the material from Brittany which will lead to a <A HREF="#corpus">published
corpus</A>.
<H2>
The Material</H2>
The scope of the project is the Celtic-speaking regions of the early middle
ages, (Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Brittany, the Isle of Man, and parts of
western England, in the period approximately AD 400-1100). Included are
all stone monuments inscribed with text, whether in the Celtic vernacular
or Latin, in the Roman alphabet or ogham (but excluding runic inscriptions).
This material constitutes primary data of unique evidential value to historians,
archaeologists, historical geographers, palaeographers, epigraphers, art
historians, medieval Latinists and Celtic linguists.
<H2>
The Work</H2>
CISP's primary objectives are:
<UL>
<LI>
to create a comprehensive database of all known inscribed stones and present
it to scholars in a usable form</LI>

<LI>
to produce a definitive corpus of the inscribed stones of early medieval
Brittany</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="database"></A>The Database</H3>
Information for the database is being drawn from a variety of sources including
published and unpublished work and internet resources.&nbsp; The database
incorporates details of present and former location(s), physical characteristics,
readings and expansions, previous work, bibliographic information and,
where available, images. The electronic storage format will allow periodic
updating of the database as research progresses in the future. Data entry
is in an advanced stage with material from Dumnonia, rest of England, Wales,
Scotland (Roman only), Isle of Man and Brittany having been largely input.
Currently (Autumn 1998) the material from Ireland is being input to the
system.

<P>The database is implemented in Visual dBase 5.5, and has a fully relational
data structure.&nbsp; A <A HREF="cisp1.jpg">data entry application</A>
has been written by Kris Lockyear to enable easy and consistent data entry.

<P>The database will be made available in a reduced form over the World
Wide Web.&nbsp; A full version of the database, along with a stand-alone
application, will be made available on CD-ROM or DVD, along with a paper
version of the manual.&nbsp; This will be distributed at cost.&nbsp; It
is hoped the first version will be available by the end of 1999, and the
final version by the end of 2001.
<H3>
<A NAME="corpus"></A>Corpus of the Inscribed Stones of Brittany</H3>
Brittany was excluded from R. A. S. Macalister's great <I>Corpus Inscriptionum
Insularum Celticarum</I> (1945-1949), still the fundamental reference for
medieval Celtic inscribed stones.&nbsp; As a result the Breton material
has not been considered alongside the Insular material, as it should be.
To rectify this omission CISP has focussed on the production of a detailed
study of the early medieval inscriptions of Brittany, which will be published
as a separate corpus. Antiquarian and other accounts have been consulted
and all extant stones have been examined in the field. The stones were
recorded by a variety of means including photography, rubbings and squeezes.
The relevant parts of the early 19th century cadastral maps have also been
examined.

<P>The target publication date for the volume, to be entitled <I>The Inscriptions
of Early Medieval Brittany,</I> is towards the end of 2000. It is being
written by Wendy Davies, Katherine Forsyth, James Graham-Campbell, Mark
Handley, Paul Kershaw, John Koch, Gwena&euml;l Le Duc and Kris Lockyear,
and will be published by <I>Celtic Studies Publications</I>. The volume
will contain a parallel English and French text.

<P>Here are some <A HREF="brittany.htm">photographs</A> of the Breton material
taken during fieldwork in May 1997.
