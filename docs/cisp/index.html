    <h2>Celtic Inscribed Stones Project (CISP)</h2>

    <p>
      The Project (CISP) is a joint project of the Department of History and the
      Institute of Archaeology under the direction of Prof. Wendy Davies in
      collaboration with Prof. James Graham-Campbell. The project was funded by
      the Humanities Research Board, the Arts and Humanities Research Board and
      University College London.&nbsp; The project currently has two
      <a href="#mark">research fellows</a>: Kris Lockyear and Mark Handley.
    </p>

    <p>
      CISP is undertaking a collaborative, interdisciplinary study of Medieval
      Celtic inscriptions. One of its main objectives is the compilation of an
      accessible, comprehensive and authoritative
      <a href="#database">database</a> of all known inscriptions. By bringing
      this material together in one place and making it readily available our
      goal is to turn what is a largely untapped resource into usable
      material.&nbsp; Additionally, field work has been undertaken by Katherine
      Forsyth (former Research Fellow), Kris Lockyear, Mark Handley, Paul
      Kershaw (former Research Fellow), James Graham-Campbell and Wendy Davies
      on the material from Brittany and the Channel Islands which will lead to a
      <a href="#corpus">published corpus</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Material</h2>

    <p>
      The scope of the project is the Celtic-speaking regions of the early
      middle ages, (Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Brittany, the Isle of Man, and
      parts of western England, in the period approximately AD 400-1100).
      Included are all stone monuments inscribed with text, whether in the
      Celtic vernacular or Latin, in the Roman alphabet or ogham (but excluding
      runic inscriptions). This material constitutes primary data of unique
      evidential value to historians, archaeologists, historical geographers,
      palaeographers, epigraphers, art historians, medieval Latinists and Celtic
      linguists.
    </p>

    <h2>The Work</h2>

    <p>CISP's primary objectives are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        to create a comprehensive database of all known inscribed stones and
        present it to scholars in a usable form
      </li>

      <li>
        to produce a definitive corpus of the inscribed stones of early medieval
        Brittany
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="database"></a>The Database</h3>

    <p>
      Information for the database is being drawn from a variety of sources
      including published and unpublished work and internet resources.&nbsp; The
      database incorporates details of present and former location(s), physical
      characteristics, readings and expansions, previous work, bibliographic
      information and, where available, images. The electronic storage format
      will allow periodic updating of the database as research progresses in the
      future. Data entry was completed in 1999. Its authors are Katherine
      Forsyth, Mark Handley, Paul Kershaw, Kris Lockyear, with Wendy Davies,
      James Graham-Campbell and John-Paul Wilson.
    </p>

    <p>
      The database was originally implemented in Visual dBase 5.5, and has a
      fully relational data structure.&nbsp; A
      <a href="cisp1.jpg">data entry application</a> was written by Kris
      Lockyear to enable easy and consistent data entry. Subsequently, the
      database was transferred to Microsoft Access, and an application written
      by Mike Gahan (database consultant) to create web pages of the data. P>The
      <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/"
        >database is available over the World Wide Web</a
      >
      in a preliminary version; corrections and additions will be incorporated
      and the search facility enhanced in future releases.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="corpus"></a>Corpus of the Inscribed Stones of Brittany</h3>

    Brittany was excluded from R. A. S. Macalister's great
    <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum</i>
    (1945-1949), still the fundamental reference for medieval Celtic inscribed
    stones.&nbsp; As a result the Breton material has not been considered
    alongside the Insular material, as it should be. To rectify this omission
    CISP has focussed on the production of a detailed study of the early
    medieval inscriptions of Brittany, which will be published as a separate
    corpus. Antiquarian and other accounts have been consulted and all extant
    stones have been examined in the field. The stones were recorded by a
    variety of means including photography, rubbings and squeezes. The relevant
    parts of the early 19th century cadastral maps have also been examined.

    <p>
      The volume, entitled <i>The Inscriptions of Early Medieval Brittany,</i>,
      went to press in January 2000 and will appear by December 2000. It was
      written by Wendy Davies, James Graham-Campbell, Mark Handley, Paul
      Kershaw, John Koch, Gwena&euml;l Le Duc and Kris Lockyear, and is being
      published by <i>Celtic Studies Publications</i>. The volume contains a
      parallel English and French text.

      material taken during fieldwork in May 1997. <br />
