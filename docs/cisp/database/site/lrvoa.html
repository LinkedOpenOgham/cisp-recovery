<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Davies et al/2000, 119, `The <em>bourg</em> of Lanrivoaré lies in the far north west of Brittany, 9km from the west coast; the bedrock is granite. At 90m above sea level, it has a slightly elevated position in relation to the surrounding landscape; there are several water courses in the immediate neighbourhood of the <em>bourg</em> and the <em>lavoir</em> remains visible, on the eastern side of the road D168. The <em>bourg</em> is situated in land of good agricultural quality, although present land-use is largely pasture; when the 1844 cadastral survey was drawn, there was meadow within the immediate neighbourhood of the houses but plenty of arable land in the surrounding area (ADF 3P Lanrivoaré).</em>
<p>The church and churchyard stand at the north-eastern edge of the <em>bourg</em>, and are focal to neither housing nor road patterns; in 1844 the <em>bourg</em> had the character of a collection of dispersed hamlets rather than a nucleated village. Nothing therefore suggests that it was the centre of a very early parish, although it appears to have achieved parish status by the 13th century (Vallerie/1986, 186). There is good evidence, however, that it was the focus of an early medieval ecclesiastical settlement, since a religious foundation at Lanrivoaré, with its attendant properties, was the subject of a grant to the monastery of Landévennec in the 10th or 11th century, quite probably in the mid-10th (CL no. 39; Davies/1986, 93--94). Clearly, from this text, the foundation was already in existence at the time that it was absorbed by the Landévennec group and the cartulary title (<em>de tribu</em>, i.e. `tref', settlement) also makes it clear that people lived there. The place was very much an outlier of the Landévennec network (see the map at Davies 1986: 89), perhaps suggesting that the properties were valuable and well worth the journey to inspect and to collect returns (they were later transferred to Saint-Matthieu-de-Fine-Terre)'.</em>
