<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Power et al/1997, 229, No. 8468: `<em>Ringfort</em> In pasture, on edge of steep natural slope down to flat marshy land bordering Tanyard stream. Depicted as roughly circular enclosure (diam. <em>c</em>. 30m) on 1842, 1904 and 1936 OS maps. Bulldozed in 1960s leaving short section of bank to E and SE. Excavated by B. O. Donnabháin (forthcoming) after discovery of souterrain (8912) containing ogham stones (7976 [LHANE/1], 7977 [LHANE/2]) at centre during gravel quarrying in 1981. Preliminary account of first season's excavations published by O Donnabháin (1983, 217).  Bank (H 1.3m) survived on E side for <em>c</em>. 10m, incorporated into field-fence system; stone kerb (one course) on internal side; external fosse (original Wth 3m; D 2m). From landowner's description prior to destruction of site it appears likely that natural drop on N side may have functioned as defence here. Entrance to SE with causeway (Wth 5m). Interior disturbed by bulldozing activity in 1960s and before that by lazy-bed cultivation; foundations of circular structure (diam. 4m) uncovered. Finds included yellow glass bead with herring bone design, rotary hone-stone and William and Mary penny. Urn burial (7899) found during excavation in 1984'.</em>
<p>Power et al/1997, 281, No. 8912: `<em>Souterrain</em> In centre of ringfort (8468). Excavated by B. O Donnabháin over three seasons from 1982--4.  Large stone-built gallery (L 24.55m) roofed with stone lintels; two 90° turns and one U-shaped turn divide the gallery into four sections; there are no chambers <em>per se</em>. Section 1: entrance passage (L 4.8m; Wth 0.45--0.6m), immediately below modern ground level. U-shaped creepway (Wth 0.5m; H 0.5m) connected sections 1 and 2. Section 2: (L. 6.15m) sloped steeply downwards. A 90° turn separated segments 2 and 3. Section 3: (L 5.9m; Wth 1.25m; H 1.4m) level; stone-built air-vent at roof level. Another 90° turn separated sections 3 and 4. Section 4: (L 7.65m; Wth 1.3m; H 1.35m--1.45m), also level; air vent at roof level; stone-lined drain runs 11m from end of chamber, exiting outside site to N. Construction trench averaged 2.2m wide and up to 3.5m below modern ground level; charcoal from trench yielded radiocarbon dates that centre on 6th century AD. Two lintels, both from section 2, were ogham inscribed'.</em>
