<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Davies et al/2000, 235: `The hamlet of Le Plec lies in the water-dominated landscape of the Etel River, at the northern end of a peninsula which is 6km long, 2km wide at its broadest part, joined to the mainland on the eastern side of the estuary by a sandbank -- covered only at exceptionally high tides;...access to the site would not therefore have been easy by road before the 19th and 20th centuries and it was not a focus for major settlement. The chapel site is 6m above sea level and the bedrock is granite. The coast lies 8.5km to the south and the Prostlon stone [LCOAL/1] just over 2km to the south east, though much farther by road.</em>
<p>At the time the cadastral map of 1845 was drawn the settlement was slightly larger, with two <em>rangées</em> west of the chapel, but still small; it was mostly surrounded by meadow, although there was some arable land-use (unlike its current uncultivated or rough pasture character) (ADM 3P439 du Plec, section A5). There is a cross marked on the chapel; given that this surveyor was meticulous in marking (largely road-side) crosses, and did not normally mark churches and chapels in this way, it is possible that the cross denotes the boulder [LPLEC/1].</em>
<p>The chapel, the fabric of which is early 17th century in date, is dedicated to Sainte Brigitte. Other monuments in the neighbourhood also share the association with Brigit: the 3m-high Quéguil-Bréhet `Brigit's distaff' on the causeway and, nearby, a smaller stone Gourhet-Brehet `Brigit's spindle'. However, the origin of these associations is unclear and they throw no light on the early medieval context of the site'.</em>
