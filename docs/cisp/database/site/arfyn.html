<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>White/1971-72, 19--51. The stone was found re-used as part of a grave within a long-cist cemetery. This cemetery had graves oriented both N-S and E-W, and is dated to between the fifth and sixth century. Two or three of the graves had post-holes at the head of the grave suggesting the erection of grave markers, probably of wood.</em>
<p>In 1732 Lewis Morris noted that at Arfryn, 'There is an ancient burying place lately discovered in this parich abt 1/2 a mile of ye church and stone coffins dug up with their heads to the south: In a place called pen Eglwys Edern: al. pen Eglwys Leder where there is also a stone called llex Edern'. Quoted in White/1971-72, 30.</em>
<p>White/1971-72, 40--41, argues that the central feature of the cemetery was `a floor of small pebbles ... surrounded by a ring of stakes' associated with a burial, the final phase of which `seems to have been a small wooden chapel or oratory'.</em>
<p>Edwards/1986, 31--34, argues that the central feature of the cemetery was a small wooden chapel erected over a grave.</em>
