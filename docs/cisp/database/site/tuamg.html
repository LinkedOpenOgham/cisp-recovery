<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Macalister/1949, 92: `[a] cemetery surrounding the ancient church at this place'.</em>
<p>Okasha/Forsyth/2001, 115: `Tuamgraney, by the shores of Lough Derg, 6.5 km from Inishcaltra, was an important monastery reputedly founded by St Cronán, perhaps the Cronán, abbot of Clonmacnoise who died in 638. There were continuing close connections with Clonmacnoise; several coarbs of Cronán in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth century were also coarbs of Ciarán of Clonmacnoise. The obits of several lectors of Tuamgraney in the first quarter of the eleventh century attested to the site's influence as a centre of learning (see, for example, Annals of Innisfallen 1010, 1020 ...)  A church and round tower were supposedly built in the tenth century. No trace of the round tower remains but the church contains some early features, perhaps dating from the tenth century, as well as some twelfth-century work, and is `probably the oldest Irish church still in use''.</em>
