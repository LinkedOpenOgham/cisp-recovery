<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Petrie/1878, 35: `MONA-INCHA is situated in the townland of Tighmoney, parish of Corbally, and barony of Ikeran, in the county of Tipperary. The name signifies `the Bog of the Island,' from [<em>Móin Mone</em>], `a bog' and <em>Incha</em>, `Island'. A small but deep lake in this bog is all that now remains of Loch Cre, from which the island was formerly called Inis locha Cre'.</em>
<p>Petrie then relates some of the history of the site, primarily concerning the abbey:</em>
<p>`The remains at Mona-incha now consist of the ruins of a very beautiful church, with richly sculptured western doorway and chancel arch, probably built in the twelfth century, and a portion of the shaft of a cross covered with Celtic ornamental design.  Three inscribed stones have been discovered in the church'.</em>
<p>Okasha/Forsyth/2001, 212--213: `Monaincha was once an island in a bog but is now a mound in marshy pasture land. Traditionally it was founded by St Cainnech of Aghaboe in the seventh century and served as a hermit retreat ... It is also associated in the hagiographic sources with St Crónan of Roscrea ... The earliest annalistic reference to the site is the death of Elarius `anchorite and scribe of Loch Cré' <em>s.a.</em> 806 ... The earliest building no on Monaincha is the ruined but highly ornate Romanesque church; built in the twelfth century, the church had alterations and additions made to it in the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries .. Petrie recorded the existence of `a portion of the shaft of a cross covered with Celtic ornamental design'. This may refer to the twelfth-century corss now re-erected to the west of the church ... Crawford also recorded an uninscribed cross-slab then lying north-east of the chancel'.</em>
