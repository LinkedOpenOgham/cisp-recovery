<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>Okasha/Forsyth/2001, 160: `Innisfallen is the largest of several islands in Lough Leane. In the seventh century the island was at the heart of the territory of Munster's dominant political group, the Eóganacht Locha Léine. According to tradition the monastery of Innisfallen was founded in the seventh century by Finian the Leper. It is mentioned several times in the Annals, being twice plundered by Vikings, and was renowned as a centre of learning into the fourteenth century. The Annals of Innisfallen (Oxford, Bodleian Ms. Rawl. B503), the oldest major collection of Irish annals, which was begun at Emly around 1092, was still being continued on the island around 1215. The oldest surviving structure on Innisfallen is the remains of an early church incorporated as the western two-thirds of the later Abbey church. The <em>antae</em> and the (restored) flat-headed doorway, indicate a tenth-century date for this building. ... In addition to the inscribed slab there are seven other pieces of early sculpture, all large recumbent slabs'.</em>
