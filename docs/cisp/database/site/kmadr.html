<h3>Site Notes</h3>
<p>NMRS/NX4NE1: `this church, which served the medieval parish of Toskerton, stood within its walled burial-ground on a low rise 410m S of South Cairnweil farmsteading. The site is occupied by a burial-aisle of the MacTaggarts of Ardwell which incorporates some earlier masonry, most noticeably at the E end, and may preserve the ground-plan of the former church (the aisle measures 12.7m by 5.6m within walls 0.9m thick). Three Early Christian inscribed stones, and five cross-fragments which range in date from the 8th to the 12th century, found on, or near, the site, are displayed in the porch at the W end of the aisle'.</em>
<p>Previously unenclosed burial ground walled in 1840x1844 (Scott/1917, 355).</em>
<p>Craig/1997, 618: `The present burial ground is a raised mound situated on the crest of a low ridge'.</em>
<p>NMRS/NX04NE1: `site is a natural outcrop of rock, crowned by modern church 15' [4.5m] above surrounding fields'.</em>
<p>Craig/1997, 618: `Despite lack of excavation the site has produced about ten cross-slabs'.</em>
<p>NMRS/NX04NE1: `the old church was dedicated to St Medran of Muskerry and belonged to Whithorn Priory'.</em>
<p>The parish of Kirkmadrine, formerly called Toskerton, was united to Stoneykirk in 1618.</em>
<p>Watson/1926, 162--163: `Kirkmadrine, in Sorbie and Stoneykirk parishes, has the stress on -<em>drine</em>, which therefore represents the saint's name. No such name appears in the Calendars, but the tract on the mothers of the Irish saints...[mentions a] Draigne of Sruthair...<em>Draigne</em> becomes <em>Draighne</em>, with <em>gh</em> silent, in Mid. and Mod. Gaelic, and would naturally be <em>Drine</em> in English. Kirkmadroyn, the spelling in Macfarlane (ii. p.81) represents the Gaelic pronunciation. Kirkdrine, in Kirkmaiden parish, contains his name without the honorific <em>mo</em> or <em>ma</em>, my...[We] may take it that he was a Briton by origin, and we may suppose that he was connected with Whithorn'.</em>
