<P>
This chapter firstly defines the `domain of
discourse',<A NAME="208"></A> the information to be
recorded in the database, and the discusses the structure of the
database in the light of the concepts discussed in the previous
chapter. Throughout this guide the following conventions are used:
table (relation) names are given in <SMALL>SMALL CAPITALS</SMALL>, field
(or column) names are given in a <TT>fixed space font</TT> and
allowed entries for a restricted field in <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">bold type</SPAN>.

<LI>lower limit -- earliest non-Roman inscriptions in the region
</LI>
<LI>upper limit -- <SPAN  CLASS="textit">c.</SPAN> 1100. This may need to be further defined
on a region-by-region basis. Since not all stones are closely datable it may
be necessary to decide to include all examples of a particular sub-type

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00220000000000000000">
Doubtful inscriptions and lost stones</A>
</H1>

<P>
N.B. `Lost' refers to stones not inscriptions.
If the stone is extant but the inscription is no
longer visible (whether through extreme wear or
because the inscribed portion has been
broken and lost) it is `doubtful' only if the extant
descriptions and illustrations are unreliable.

<P>
`Lost' stones are those which have been described and/or
illustrated by a credible authority but whose current whereabouts
are unknown (stones which have been destroyed, stolen, or
mislaid). They are described as normal and the current location is
given as `lost'. The dating parameters for their loss are noted
(see the <SMALL>LOST</SMALL><A NAME="1572"></A> table below).

<P>
If there is doubt that the inscription on a lost stone was genuine,
for instance if the description
is ambiguous or fantastical, then the stone and its inscription
are listed as normal and `doubtful' is recorded in the inscription table.
The same goes for extant stones if there is
doubt that visible scores (a) are artificial, (b) represent lettering,
or (c) date to the early medieval period.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00230000000000000000">
The structure of the <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> database</A>
</H1>

<P>
The <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> database  is comprised  of a
primary group of five tables, each in a one-to-many relationship with another
table in a hierarchy.<A NAME="1493"></A> These tables
form the core of the database.
As it is an explicit aim of the project to examine these
monuments in their wider context, the first primary table is the
<SMALL>SITE</SMALL><A NAME="1577"></A> table. Each site is given a primary key in the form of a
five letter code. Any one site, however, can have more than one stone--there
is a one-to-many relationship<A NAME="238"></A> between sites
and stones. The stones are, therefore, recorded in a separate
table (<SMALL>STONE</SMALL><A NAME="1580"></A>), and linked via the site's primary key.
Similarly, any one stone can have more than one inscription and thus we have
another one-to-many relationship and a third table (<SMALL>INSCRIP</SMALL><A NAME="1583"></A>).
Similarly, any one inscription can have more than one reading, and an
authority can provide us
with more than one interpretation of a reading. This gives us the fourth and
fifth tables (<SMALL>READING</SMALL><A NAME="1586"></A> &amp; <SMALL>TRANSLAT</SMALL><A NAME="1589"></A>).

<P>
For each of these primary tables there are some related subsidary
tables.<A NAME="1494"></A> For
example, a site may be known by more than one name. <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> will record the
most commonly used name in the <SMALL>SITE</SMALL><A NAME="1593"></A> 
table. Alternative names, if any, are stored in a separate table,
<SMALL>ALT</SMALL>_<SMALL>NAME</SMALL><A NAME="1596"></A>. This allows a site to be accessed using any of the
possible site names.
 Figures <A HREF="node2.html#site">2</A>-<A HREF="node2.html#reading">5</A> show the
five main tables, and their relationship to the other primary tables, and
their subsidiary tables.

In addition to these five main tables and the subsidiary tables, there are a
large number of simple and hierarchical look-up

These perform the functions discussed above (see page <A HREF="node1.html#lookup"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.gif"></A>); all
are listed in the next chapter and the hierarchical tables are discussed in

We have, therefore, five primary tables which have a set of
related secondary tables and look-up tables. These tables form the
core of the <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> database. There are a number of other tables --
it is helpful to divide the database into three groups or
subsystems (see Figure <A HREF="node2.html#systems">6</A>). These are the core,
bibliography and image subsystems.

<P>
The bibliography subsystem has one primary table, <SMALL>BIBLIOG</SMALL><A NAME="1616"></A> which will
contain all the references to published sources and systematic archives such
as sites and monuments records. This table is connected to four of the
primary tables via a series of linking tables (see page
<A HREF="node1.html#linking"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.gif"></A>).<A NAME="1501"></A> It is also
connected to the <SMALL>NAME</SMALL><A NAME="1619"></A> table and the <SMALL>IMAGE</SMALL><A NAME="1622"></A> table. These
linking tables contain, as well as the necessary linking information, further
data such as specific page numbers, and an indication of the value of the
reference, `major discussion' or `passing mention'.  Finally, the
<SMALL>CORPORA</SMALL><A NAME="1625"></A> table forms an alternative link between the <SMALL>INSCRIP</SMALL><A NAME="1628"></A> 
and <SMALL>BIBLIOG</SMALL><A NAME="1631"></A> tables and allows the retrieval of inscriptions by their
standard reference numbers such as those in Macalister
Macalister:1945,Macalister:1949. Figure <A HREF="node2.html#bibliog">7</A> illustrates
the relationships.

The <SMALL>IMAGE</SMALL><A NAME="1634"></A> table stores images of sites, stones and inscriptions.
This table has a many-to-many relationship with three of the primary tables
and the bibliography table, and is therefore linked to them via intermediate
linking tables. Lastly, the <SMALL>CISPARCH</SMALL><A NAME="1637"></A> table records information about
the <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> archive including photographs, rubbings and correspondence. This
table is linked to the <SMALL>SITE</SMALL><A NAME="1641"></A>, <SMALL>STONE</SMALL><A NAME="1644"></A>, and <SMALL>INSCRIP</SMALL><A NAME="1647"></A> 
tables via further linking tables. Figure <A HREF="node2.html#imgarch">8</A> illustrates these
last relationships.

Although this data structure is complex, it allows for flexible data
retrieval, and for future expansion of the project. For example, no changes
to the structure of the database would be required in order to add runic and
Anglo-Saxon inscriptions to the system, although some of the terms in the
look-up tables might well need expansion. Portable artefacts could be added
by creating an artefact table in parallel to the <SMALL>STONE</SMALL><A NAME="1650"></A> table, or
more detailed recording of decoration or form could be added by creating
further tables also linked to the <SMALL>STONE</SMALL><A NAME="1653"></A> table.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00240000000000000000">
Data definition strategy</A>
</H1>

<P>
Tables in the <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> database consist of three basic types of fields. The
first group are relatively short but unrestricted fields such as place names,
measurements, or readings of inscriptions. The second group are fields with a
very restricted range of entries controlled by look-up
tables.<A NAME="304"></A> The final group of fields are memo or very long
string fields.<A NAME="305"></A> Database purists dislike this type of field
as it is unstructured and can lead to poor efficiency in data retrieval.
In the case of the <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> database, it was felt that there were many cases
where free form text was necessary, and an even more complex data structure
would be counter-productive. In these situations, some information is stored
in a structured format in restricted fields, and some in a memo format. For
example, the <SMALL>STONE</SMALL><A NAME="1658"></A> table has two logical (yes/no) fields,
<TT>cross</TT><A NAME="1661"></A> and <TT>other_carve</TT><A NAME="1664"></A> which record whether a stone has an
inscribed cross and/or other carved decoration. If the answer is yes, further
structured details are stored in the <SMALL>INSCROSS</SMALL><A NAME="1667"></A> and/or
<SMALL>DECORATN</SMALL><A NAME="1670"></A> tables, and a fuller, free text description is entered into
the <SMALL>DECOR</SMALL>_<SMALL>NOTES</SMALL><A NAME="1673"></A> memo field.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00251000000000000000">
Hardware and software</A>
</H2>
The above data schema is a theoretical construct derived from the information
<SMALL>CISP</SMALL> wishes to record. This schema is independent of software or hardware
platforms, it can be implemented using different RDMSs on different types
of computer. As a result, the database can be moved (`ported') from one
computer package to another with relatively few problems.

<P>
The primary obstacle to data transfer between systems is that different
packages have different methods for storing data. For example, and
paradox store long text (memo) fields in a separate computer file.
These memo fields are of unlimited length whereas other strings are limited
to 256 characters. Microsoft access can store strings up to 64kbytes
as part of the main table.

<P>
The database was originally implemented using <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Visual</SPAN> dB<SMALL>ASE</SMALL> 5.5 on a
Pentium 133mhz PC.<A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot316"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A> One copy of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Visual</SPAN> dB<SMALL>ASE</SMALL> client-server bundle of
computer programs was purchased which includes a program to help
ease data transfer between different database systems.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00252000000000000000">
The data entry application</A>
</H2>

<P>
The complex nature of the <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> database necessitated the construction of a
data input application which was written by the author using <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Visual</SPAN> dB<SMALL>ASE</SMALL>'s
`object orientated' programming language.<A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot318"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A> Currently, only a single site/stone
addition/browsing capability has been implemented. This application
speeds up data entry, and helps minimise errors by the automatic creation and
linking of primary keys wherever possible. The application allows the user to
easily navigate around related sets of tables.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00253000000000000000">
Database dissemination</A>
</H2>

<P>
It has been decided to mount the first release of the database on
UCL's Oracle database server which will be accessible via a
relatively simple database application accessible through the Web.

<P>
No decisions have been made as to the method by which the full and
final version of the <SMALL>CISP</SMALL> database is to be disseminated. This is
to keep the options open given the rapid development of computer
technology, particularly the Internet. There are a number of
possible options currently available, none of which need be
exclusive.

<UL>
<LI>Submission of the database to the archaeology section of the Humanities
Data Archive currently based in York. This is a requirement of the
Project's funding.
</LI>
<LI>Dissemination of the data on disk, most probably on a <SMALL>CD-ROM</SMALL>.
It would be possible to provide a compiled version of the database
application (a version of the application which did not require the user
to have <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Visual</SPAN> dB<SMALL>ASE</SMALL>) as well as the data.
</LI>
<LI>Providing an interface to the database via the World Wide Web.
