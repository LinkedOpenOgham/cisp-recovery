<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 290--91: `Burials have been noted in and around the <em>bourg</em> of Visseiche since the 19th century, particularly to the south of the parish church, in the presbytery garden and south of the village, on the north side of the main road. In 1985 the local council decided to construct a sports field south of the <em>bourg</em>, between it, the river, and the 19th-century cemetery; burials and cist-graves quickly became evident once work started and ultimately 78 burials were excavated by SRAB, as well as hearths and ditches. <p>These included 14 dug graves, 19 limestone sarcophagi, 45 slate cist-graves, and possibly the remains of a wooden coffin. Grave 33 was much larger than the others, being a compact group of four cist graves; in plan the cover, consisting of four slate slabs, measured 198cm x 202cm. Underneath the cover were discovered two inscribed pieces of slate, one of which was face down and the other is reported to have been an internal partition, i.e. the side panel of one of the four aligned graves.<p>The stones were examined by members of the CISP team in May 1997 and June 1999, and the site was visited at the latter date.'</em>

The majority of the letter-forms are perfectly standard capitals, such as the angular Vs, the Is and the T. Other letters diverge from this, such as the initial G, made of a series of angled strokes and one curved stroke. This letter form is otherwise unknown in Brittany, but common elsewhere in France and the Rhineland. The two Es have ascenders that extend above and below the cross strokes, while in the two Ns the ascenders are close together, giving them a narrow aspect. The ascenders of the H are of uneven length. The first letter of the second piece of stone is a minuscule Q with a down-stroke cut short by fracturing and an open-topped bow. A partial parallel for this may be found from Saint-Michel-en-Grève [SMGRV], where the P may have an open-topped bow. The two examples of C and S are different from each other - a characteristic found in other inscriptions of this corpus...The first C is rounded, the second extremely open, while the first S is majuscule and the second half-uncial. Like the G, the majuscule S consists of a series of joined straight strokes and one curved stroke, this time forming the bottom of the letter. A similar form of S, where the lower bow is smaller than the one above, is known from Bais [BAIS/4/]. <p>The lettering is largely in capitals, but with some half-uncial, and this combined with the form of the initial G suggests that the carving was done in the 6th or 7th century.'</em>

Davies et al/2000, 295--96: `GENNOVEUS is a masculine nominative name (correctly used as the subject of the verb). Though Frankish influence might be expected at this period this far east, we have found no closely similar Germanic formations. Even taking the first syllable only, Germanic names in <em>Gen-</em> are uncommon. For example, the only instance in [Gregory of Tours'] DLH is <em>Genobaudes</em>, a 4th-century Frankish chief (ii.9, citing the lost chronicle of Sulpicius Alexander). <p>Still confining the comparison to the first syllable, the Indo-European root <em>g'en-</em> 'to be born' is very common in Celtic names, e.g., OB <em>Anau-gen</em>, <em>Hoiarn-gen</em>, etc. But to have <em>Genn-</em> in initial position with double <em>-nn-</em> is less usual, although OB commonly writes double <em>-nn-</em> as single, as in, e.g. <em>Ran</em> for <em>Rann</em> and <em>uuin</em> for <em>uuinn</em>, which suggests that some parallels may have been lost. That said, nonetheless the unique form <em>Gennai</em> occurs (CR no. 75); it is not impossible that <em>Gennoueus</em> is an older, Latinized, spelling of this same name. With these, compare also <em>Genaius</em> from Mawgan, Cornwall [MAWGN/1]. Forms with double <em>-nn-</em> occur in Gaulish: thus, <em>Adgennia</em>, <em>Adgennius</em>, <em>Adgennorix</em>. <em>Congenniccus</em> occurs in both Britain and Narbonensis. It is not certain that the elements <em>gen-</em> and <em>genn-</em> are related in all instances. However, in <em>Gennoueus</em> and <em>Gennai</em> the doubling could be a feature of the formation of hypocoristics (pet names), thus based on an original compound in <em>Geno-</em>.<p>As Gregory of Tours also shows, St Geneviève (<em>Genouefa</em> or <em>Genoueua</em>) had been revered in Paris from the time of Clovis (DLH iv.1). If the double <em>-nn-</em> is not phonologically meaningful, <em>Gen[n]oueus</em> could be a masculine form of <em>Genoueua</em>, possibly reflecting the westward spread of the cult in Merovingian times. Geneviève herself is traditionally regarded as a 5th-century Gallo-Roman from Nanterre (<em>Nemetodurus</em>) near Paris. Hagiography represents her as a follower of Germanus of Auxerre and the daughter of a Severus and a Gerontia, the latter name having British affinities. The name <em>Genoueua</em> was therefore presumably also of Roman or Celtic origin. Again, assuming a correctly single <em>-n-</em>, Latin or Romano-Celtic <em>Gen<n>oueus</em> and <em>Genoueua</em>  could be connected with the place-names <em>Genoa</em> or <em>Geneva</em>, both anciently <em>Genu(u)a</em>, the latter also <em>Genaua</em>. In the case of Geneva, <em>Genua</em> was applied by Caesar to a pre-Roman <em>oppidum</em> and was thus probably a pre-Roman Celtic name, corresponding to Breton and OW <em>genou</em> 'mouth (of a river)', which suits the place. Thus, feminine <em>Genoueua</em> could signify 'woman from Geneva' or from some other river-mouth settlement so named. As well as possibly deriving from the saint's name, <em>Gen<n>oueus</em> as a Latinized Brittonic or Gallo-Roman name could come directly from <em>genou</em> '(river) mouth', as opposed to deriving secondarily from 'Geneviève'.'</em>
