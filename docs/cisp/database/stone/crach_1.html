<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>first mentioned, 1854 Cayot-Delandre
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 172--173: `Cayot-Delandre seems to have been the first to refer to this stone -- as a `menhir', inscribed with crosses -- on the road to Auray, 3km from the town. Keranflec'h first saw the inscribed pillar in 1854, standing at the foot of the `Montagne de la Justice' (Mané-Justice), beside the road that crosses Le Lac'h to Auray. He presented a brief description at the Brest congress of the Association bretonne in 1856, citing a somewhat inaccurate drawing of the stone by Jorand, published without explanation in E. Breton and A. Jouffroy's Introduction à l'Histoire de France. When Keranflec'h saw the stone it was already broken and the lower part had disappeared (as seems to have been the case when Cayot-Delandre saw it), but within a few years the missing portion had been recovered. In 1857 or 1858 Louis Rosenzweig, archivist of the Morbihan, noticed incised letters on a lump of stone then used as a seat outside the château of Plessis-Kaer, less than 1km to the south east of Mané-Justice, and previously used as a hearthstone. Keranflec'h took an impression of the Plessis-Kaer stone which, when put together with the fragment at Mané-Justice, proved a perfect fit. Now able to offer a reading, Keranflec'h presented a full account to the 1858 Quimper congress of the Association bretonne. That year the two parts of the stone were presented to the Société Polymathique du Morbihan by Comtesse Henriette de Gouvello of Kérentré, proprietor of Mané-Justice, and by M. Cauzic, proprietor of the château of Plessis-Kaer. The two halves were cemented together and now stand in the courtyard of the Château Gaillard, Vannes, home of the Société Polymathique and its archaeological museum. Le Mené's illustration of 1888 shows the two halves of the stone reunited and standing in open countryside. This seems to be a reconstruction rather than a record of the stone in situ since, by that time, the stone had been in the Vannes museum for 25 years.<p>Keranflec'h maintained that the fracture bore the traces of iron wedges and that the stone had been deliberately broken up by a stone-mason for use in a structure. The stone certainly seems to have been deliberately split, since the fracture is clean. Marsille's discussion of palaeography, language, names, and parallels is by far the fullest extant treatment, and he includes both a drawing and a cross-section.<p>Former site and the stone were visited by members of the CISP team in May 1997, September 1998, and June 1999'.</em>

Nash-Williams/1950, no. 148, reading <em>fi</em> for <em>fili</em>); and <em>fil</em> for <em>filia</em> occurs on 3rd/4th-century Gallic stones and a 5th-century Italian stone (LeBlant/1865 no. 86C#2; AE (1981) no. 608; Diehl/1927--31 no. 4026B; Binazzi/1989 no. 118)<p>line 4:  the second letter could be read as Roman numeral III or, more likely given the M in line 1, an M; following E there is an upright, with middle and lower portion only, making P a more likely reading than X. Given the date of the inscription (see below), AMSE[.] is most easily read as an age clause: A for <em>anno/um</em> occurs in Roman and early medieval inscriptions (e.g. Collingwood/Wright/1965, no. 295; AE (1972) no. 316; AE (1983) no. 699; AE (1991) no. 943; Boppert/1971 no. -lindis; Alföldy/1973 no. 949; Diehl/1927--31 no. 2750A; Carletti/1985 nos. 7, 58; Buonocare/1987 no. 37 etc. M for <em>menses</em> occurs 39 times in inscriptions from France, the Rhineland, and Spain (e.g. Vives/1969 nos. 13a, 22, 24, 25, 57, 74, 99, 138, 139, 526). More than 220 inscriptions from these areas of western Europe record the number of months lived by the commemorand; of these, 52 state the number of months in words rather than numbers and 65% of this 52 are for children aged 10 and under'.<p>Davies et al/2000, 180--81, `AMSE[.]. If we were to treat this as a single Brittonic word, noting that the missing letter at the end has an ascender, we could read <em>amser</em>. If this were correct, it would possibly represent the common word OWB <em>amser</em>, OIr. <em>aimser</em>, in which case there would be a macaronic mix of common nouns in Latin and the vernacular. The usual sense is `time', also `weather' in Ir. and Breton but it can also mean `lifetime', which might make more sense in this context.<p>RAN(N) `part, portion' is very common in the sense of `portion of land' in the names of small arable properties in the Morbihan in the 9th-century charters of CR (Davies/1988: 39--46; Tanguy/1998: 67).<p>HUBRIT is the equivalent of the common Welsh adjective <em>hyfryd</em> `lovely, pleasant'. It occurs in early personal names, e.g. OB <em>Iarn-hobrit</em> `iron' + `pleasant' (a combination of elements relevant to the present interpretation), Archaic W <em>Con-hibrit</em> (Lib. Land. no. 144) c. 635-65 (Tanguy/1998: 52). <em>Hubrit</em> consists of the optative prefix <em>hu-</em> (< Celt. <em>*su-</em>, Mod. B <em>he-</em>) + <em>brit</em> `mind, attitude, etc.' (GPC sn. <em>hyfryd</em>). The placename therefore could mean `the lovely piece [of land]'. However, as most of the <em>ran</em>-names have personal names as their second element, `the <em>ran</em> of someone named <em>Hubrit</em>' is more likely'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 178--179: `The inscription is in Insular half-uncial, as exemplified by the wedge-shaped finials on the L, D, H, N, R, and M. The F is also Insular, with an outwardly curved top stroke and an elongated cross stroke which joins with the following I. This is paralleled in an 8th- or 9th-century Breton gospel book (Lowe/1934--72 vol. 5 no. 684), and is a common feature of early medieval Insular scripts. The B of the last line is open-bowed, a form found elsewhere in this corpus [LDVEZ/1, LDAUL/1, LGUID/1, STGRH/1]. The Es are all majuscule. The third letter of the last line appears to be half-uncial S. The final letter of the inscription has a dot placed on either side of its ascender.<p>There are four quite different Rs: the first is half-uncial, with a wedge-shaped finial at the bottom of the ascender, and an up-turned end to the rightward stroke; the second has a rounded bow with an oblique stroke and no elongated ascender; the third has an elongated ascender, but has no bow, being closer to minuscule R; the fourth is certainly a minuscule R, and is paralleled by Rs from the inscription at Llangadwaladr, dated to around AD 625 (Nash-Williams/1950 no. 13). This degree of variation suggests the lack of a fully developed canonical script.<p>The As all have a flat, or slightly sloping, top stroke, a vertical right-hand ascender and a curved L-shaped stroke to join them. A short diagonal stroke extends outwards from the bottom right corner, and each of the letters appears to have a slight lean to the left. This is a rare letter form, but it is paralleled on the inscription from Languidic [LGUID/1], and in Ireland (Macalister/1949 nos. 592, 651, 869), and in a number of Insular manuscripts dated to the 7th and 8th centuries, including the Cathach of Columba (Lowe/1934--72 vol. 2 nos. 157, 213, 218, 266, 271, 275).<p>The palaeography of this inscription therefore suggests carving of the stone during the 7th or 8th century'.</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#herannuen>Herannuen</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: female)<br>
Davies et al/2000, 179--180: `HERAN(N)-. As names of father and daughter (or son), it is likely that <em>Heranal/Hera[n/h]al</em> and <em>Herannuen</em> incorporate the same first element, as does <em>Harenbili...fil Heranhal</em> (Languidic, LGUID/1). The element <em>Hoiarn</em> `iron' is very common in OB personal names: e.g. <em>Trihoiarn</em> (Loth/1890: 139-41; Tanguy/1998: 53). The more common phonological byform in initial pretonic position is <em>Iarn-</em> (cf. Jackson/1953: 361), of which there are about 40 examples in CR; cf. also OC <em>Iarn-wallon</em>. On the other hand the stressed form <em>-hoiarn</em> can occur as pretonic <em>Hoiarn-</em> as well. The OC spelling of the simplex is <em>hoern</em>. The early Welsh spellings in personal names include <em>-haiarn</em>, <em>-haern</em>, and <em>-hearn</em>. The last is common in the Llandaf and Llancarfan charters deriving from the 7th and 8th centuries where it seems to be the oldest spelling, reflecting a real stage when the triphthong <em>/eIa/</em> was not yet perceived as having three points of articulation: e.g. <em>Hearngen</em> (VC ch. 68) c. 650 or earlier, <em>Biuhearn</em> (Lib. Land. nos. 174b 176b 183b) c. 685-715, <em>Cunhearn</em> (Lib. Land. no. 184) c. 725--55 (Koch/1985/6: 44, 47). Regarding the spellings here, note that Neo-Brittonic reflexes of Old Celtic <em>*isarno-</em> behave as though from <em>*siiarno-</em>. <em>Heran(n)-</em> could be a poor spelling reflecting the same stage as Welsh <em>-hearn</em>, or the common linguistic change of r-metathesis might have occurred in a byform; cf. also apparent epenthesis in Archaic W <em>Elheiarun</em> (Lib. Land. no. 73b), the same person as <em>Elhearn</em> below. The Celtic <em>-rn-</em> cluster had a phonetically tense [n]. That is why so many early Welsh and Irish spellings with <em>-tigernn</em>, etc., for <em>-tigern</em>, occur, as does the present element OB <em>Iarnn</em>, Archaic W <em>Elharnn</em> (Lib. Land. no. 73a) c. 585-625 (the same individual as <em>Elhearn</em>). Hence the <em>Herann-</em> variant is unproblematic in that regard.<p>-UEN. The second element of the first name is probably the very common Celtic <em>uindo-</em>, <em>uinda</em> `white, bright, fair, blessed', Mod. <em>gwenn</em>. After the mid-9th century, it is more common for this element to occur as <em>uuin</em>, <em>guin</em> in masculine names, with <em>uuen</em>, <em>guen</em> as feminine. In the inscriptions from Wales, the Celtic name element <em>uindo-</em> is often spelled <em>vend-</em> in pre-syncope examples, probably pre-c. 650: e.g. Macalister/1945 no. 390 <em>vendesetli</em>, no. 376 <em>vennisetli</em>; thus, <em>-uen</em> here would not decisively indicate a post-c. 850 date. However, as the analogous lowering of <em>i</em> to <em>e</em> does not appear in <em>Hubrit</em>, <em>Herannuen</em> is most easily taken as a feminine name.'</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#heranal>Heranal</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Davies et al/2000, 179--180: `[For the HERAN(N) element see the entry for the name <em>Herannuen</em>] (H)AL. The suffix or second element of the father's name is less certain. There are several Neo-Brittonic words <em>al</em> or <em>hal</em>. As orthographic features, both mute <em>h-</em> and failure to write phonetic <em>h-</em> are found (cf. <em>Abrinum</em> `Severn' in the Life of Saint Samson, i.40 (ed. Flobert/1997: 204)). Deciding between <em>Heranal</em> and <em>Heranhal</em> is accordingly difficult'.</em>
