<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 201--203: `This striking monument stands south of the chapel at Langombrac'h, set into the ground, within a small flower bed, in the middle of a wide road junction. It was first mentioned by Keranflec'h [Keranflec'h/1856, 238], lying `beside the small chapel dedicated to St Mamert'; the stone was already damaged at that time. He also mentioned a granite coffin inside the chapel, with a lid and some bones, which had been excavated at a `more or less ancient date'. Keranflec'h soon discussed the stone again, when he indicated that he could read only the first few words and added that the bones discovered in the chapel `might well have been exhumed from the foot of the pillar' [Keranflec'h/1857: 105]. Keranflec'h returned to the subject again in the next year ][Keranflec'h/1858, 331] when he recorded that there was no local memory of exhumation; and that the stone was 213cm tall, with its eastern face inscribed. He thought that some `relatively recent' shaping of the stone had occasioned some loss of text.'<p>The site was visited by members of the CISP team in May 1997, and May and June 1999'.</em>

Height from the ground is now 167cm, with the width of each side at the base respectively: 38cm (N), 40cm (S), 64cm (E), 63cm (W); and at the top: 23cm (N), 21cm (S), 24cm (E), 23cm (W).

Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 208: `CROX The change of <em>u</em> to <em>o</em> in Latin <em>crux</em> could be taken as a Breton, or south-west Brittonic (Breton and Cornish), feature. However, in this particular word, Welsh shows the change as well. Thus, Welsh <em>croes</em> implies that Latin <em>crux</em> had been treated as British <em>*cruxa</em> (later <em>*croxa</em>), to bring the word into the more common class of Old Celtic feminine nouns in <em>-a</em>.<p>Inscriptions with a complete formula that invokes prayers from the reader can be found on 9th- and 10th-century stones from France and on earlier graffiti from Spain; this type of formula also occurs on an 8th-century inscribed stone from Ireland and in a 9th-century colophon in the Macregol Gospels (Okasha and Henderson 1992: 8-10); hence, from Tullylease `Quicu[m]quae hunc titulu(m) legerit orat pro Berechtuine' (CIIC: no. 908 [TULYS/1). A variant formula, invoking benediction from the reader, can be found on 9th- to 10th-century Welsh stones; hence, from Llanwnnws the 9th-century inscription `[IHS] XPS  q(u)icunq(ue) explicav(er)it h(oc) no(men) det benedixionem pro anima Hiroidil filius Carotinn' (ECMW no. 125 [LWNNW/1]'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 207--208: `The inscription is in half-uncial. Some of the letters indicate a debt to Insular forms, such as the `OC' A in the penultimate line, the Gs and the Rs, while others, such as the Bs in lines two and four, appear closer to late Merovingian forms. In particular the B of line four appears similar to the B of the so-called `A-B' script from Corbie and other late Merovingian scripts. Many of the letters are unexceptional, such as the rounded majuscule Es, the half-uncial Ts (one of which has a wavy contraction mark over it, of uncertain function), and the rounded and flat-bottomed Us. Some letters, in particular the Is and majuscule Ls are serifed, and this is also found on the N of line four and the minuscule H and P of line five. In lines two and seven, Is are tucked within the angle of a preceding L, and in the first line the O has been placed above the line between the R and X. Three quite different forms of M appear within the inscription. The first has ascenders one and two joined by a curved top, and ascenders two and three joined at their bottom. This is a most unusual form, but it is paralleled by a 7th- to 9th-century stone from Llanllyr, Ceredigion, in south-west Wales. The second M has the first two ascenders joined at both top and bottom, while the final example has a simple curved top stroke joining all three ascenders. The minuscule D of line three with a flat-topped bow is also very unusual, although paralleled at St Lawrence's on Jersey [STLAW/1].<p>The inscription contains two ligatures: in line three the middle stroke of the E extends to become the top stroke of a half-uncial G, and in the first line the vertical right side of an open-bowed B also serves as the ascender for an R. The use of Bs to form ligatures in this way has been seen as a distinctive Merovingian feature. The script therefore appears to be in half-uncial with both Insular and Frankish features. This mixture, as well as the mixture of forms and the presence of serifs, appears to indicate an 8th- or 9th-century date for the carving'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 208: `B/RIT[..] The element is found in the 9th-century names <em>Brit-hael</em>, <em>Britoei</em>, and <em>Britou</em>. The last two could be different spellings of the same name. <em>Britu</em> occurs in the 9th- or 10th-century Welsh Pillar of Eliseg [LTYSL/1]. <em>Brit-</em> here is perhaps the same <em>brit</em> `mind, spirit', as in <em>Hu-brit</em> of inscription [CRACH/1]. A form of the ethnic name `Briton' is also possible. So, for example, <em>Britto</em> (the singular of <em>Brittones</em> `Britons') occurs as one of the pseudo-historical namesakes in the prehistoric section of <em>Historia Brittonum</em>. There was also a <em>Britto</em> who was Bishop of Trier in the time of Magnus Maximus in the 4th century and a <em>Britto</em> from Mértola in Spain in the mid-6th century'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 208--209: `[.] DRILE/GO[..] The element <em>drich</em>, <em>drih</em>, <em>dreh</em>, <em>dri</em> meaning `aspect, face, (good) appearance' occurs in OB names, including some attested for women e.g. <em>Dri-ken</em>, <em>Roiant-dreh</em>. <p>-LE/GO[..]. If this is taken as a word or root, it is difficult to parallel. A peculiar spelling of element <em>lou</em>, <em>leu</em>, probably meaning `light', Old Celtic <em>lugu-</em>, is a possibility'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 209: `CONB[..]T~I. <em>Con-</em> from Celtic <em>*kuno-</em> `dog, wolf' is abundantly attested as the first element of OB compound names: e.g. <em>Con-car</em>, <em>Con-hael</em>, <em>Con-hoiarn</em>, <em>Con-glas</em>.<p>-B[..]T-. <em>Berth</em> is found in OB sources, but often in Germanic names: e.g. <em>Berth-uualt</em>. <em>Con-brit</em>, on the other hand, is exactly paralleled in CR. If we read `Brit(-) son of Conbrit', it would show a typical naming pattern; cf. <em>Maglus Conomagli filius</em> in the <em>Vita S. Winwaloei</em> of Wrdisten'.</em>
