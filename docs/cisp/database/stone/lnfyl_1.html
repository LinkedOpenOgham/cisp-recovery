<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Latin (rcaps)
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Rhys/1874, 333: `The Latinity of the latter part is a puzzle which I fear I cannot solve, even though I were allowed to assume ANI XIII to be a literal translation of some such Welsh construction as <em>tair blwydd ar degg</em>'.<p>Rhys/1905, interprets the inscription as an example of `Horatian metre', and provides a long commentary.<p>Macalister/1922, 215--216: `Paterninus's Latin, like his daughter, had a certain `rusticity', and it is futile to try and emend it...The construction of the genitive with <em>Hic iacit</em> is well established. It is due to a confusion of two formulae, [<em>Hic est lapis</em>] <em>Rusticae</em> and <em>Hic iacit Rustica</em>. The custom of using the genitive on stones under the influence of the first formula had become so stereotyped, that in defiance of grammar it was continued after the second formula was introduced. That the latter common formula has not been adopted mechanically on the stone before us, but has been modified by the interpolation of the words <em>in tumulo</em>, shows that some thought was given to the composition of the epitaph'. Macalister then goes on to state that he does not agree with Rhys' attempt to show the metricality of these inscriptions.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 178: `The extended formula <em>Hic in tumulo iacit</em>, like the simple <em>Hic iacit</em>, is of Christian-Roman origin. It appears in Italy in the 4th century A.D., and subsequently comes into vogue, in variant forms, in N. Africa, Gaul, and (more rarely) Spain, in the 5th and 6th centuries.[1] It occurs again in Wales on Nos. 41, 289, and 409. Mention of the age of the dead person is exceptional on a Welsh monument.[2]<p>[1] Cf. <em>ILCV</em> [Diehl/1927--31] nos. 3546 (Rome, dated A.D. 364), 1107 A (Africa), 3564 (Gaul), 3571 (Spain, dated 544).  Cf. <em>ICG</em>, ii, [LeBlant/1865] pp. ix, xix (dating the appearance of the formula on Gaul from the late 5th century A.D.).<p>[2] Such mention occurs elsewhere in Britain on one of the Cornish early inscribed stones (<em>CIIC</em>, 479 [Macalister/1945]---using the same formula as the present stone) and on the well-known Whithorn (Scotland) stone (<em>CIIC</em> 520 [Macalister/1945])'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Westwood/1876, 153: `the inscription occupying 21 inches by 19, being in Roman capital letters...cracks in the surface of the stone render it difficult to assert that the second letter of the name in the third line is an A,[1] and whether the marks after the X in the sixth line are three numeral I's.[2] There is not however the slightest ground for reading the letter before the X as a L, as has been suggested by Huebner (Inscriptiones, p. 43, No. 125)...It is clear however from several rubbings before me that the E at the end of the third line is preceded by a straight upright stroke near the first stroke of the E, which seems intended for a diphthong A/E, making the name R(E?)STA/ECE.<p>[1] It is however certainly not an E, as read by Huebner.   <p>[2] The Rev. D. R. Thomas proposes to read VI after the V (i.e. AN. IX. VI[XIT]), according to the ordinary sepulchral formula, but it appears to me that the stroke which he considers to be the first slanting stroke of the V is only a crack in the stone, extending from the middle stroke of the first N in the fifth line to below the sixth line. Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1876, p. 245) says, `Perhaps neither <em>an</em>. IXIII nor <em>an</em>. LXIII is correct, for it may possibly be <em>ani</em>. XIII for annis XIII'. The O following the three I's is very minute, and seems scarcely intended for a letter'.<p>Owen/1896, 135--136: `Mr Morris's reading...agrees with that of later epigraphists and shows that the letters now undecipherable were equally so one hundred and fifty years ago'.<p>Macalister/1922, 215: `A...flaw is responsible for Westwood's A/E at the end of the first line'.<p>Macalister/1945, 398--399: `The missing vowel in the name has been read O, E, and V; but these are all erroneous, for there is enough of the original surface remaining, flush with the bottom of the line, to have shewn recognizable portions of any of these letters. The letter was really A, and the two lower tips remain, one on each side of the groove. For some reason the inscription was left unfinished: the work was interrupted just after the engraver had blocked out in faint outline the C of PAC[E], and was never resumed. There is no justification for Huebner's reading `AN. LXIII': ANI is a mistake for <em>anni</em>. Some meddler has inserted an additional E at the beginning of the fourth line'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 178: `Roman capitals, in good style...The initial E in l. 4 is lightly picked, possibly by a different (? and later) hand'.<p>Jackson/1953, 191 note 1: `This [a reading of O for <em>Rostece</em>] seems a probable reading of the obscure letter'.</em>

Rhys/1874b, 333-34: `[this name] is more difficult on account of the second letter having disappeared with a chip of the stone into the bargain.  <em>Restece</em> stands of course for <em>Resteca/e</em>, meaning the body of <em>Resteca</em>, or (as I suspect the nominative should be) <em>Restica</em>; which seems to be a derivation from the fem. <em>Rest</em>...the Bretons had nearly allied names such as the masc. <em>Restoi</em> and <em>Restue</em> (see the <em>Cartulaire de Redon</em>)'.</em>
