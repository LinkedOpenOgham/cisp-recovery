<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>first mentioned, 1838 Chatterton, Lady H.G.M.
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Okasha/Forsyth/2001, 148: `The stone was examined and drawn by Chatterton in 1838. She described it as outside the oratory and `Near the east end', adding that it was not upright but `in a slanting position' ... Windele saw it in June of the same year and described its location as `at the NE angle of the Cell in the little burying ground attached ... In 1878 Petrie said the stone was `at the east end of the oratory' and his illustration suggests that the stone was still in the position described by Chatterton and Windele ... in 1898 the stone as still `close to the Oratory ... on the north-east side' ... In 1949 Macalister described the stone as `Formerly prostrate, but now standing in the graveyard surrounding the ancient oratory. Photographs published by Barrington (1979) and by Weir (1980) show the stone surrounded by grass but by 1986 it had been placed in its present position, set in a bed of stones'.<p>Macalister/1949, 96: `Formerly prostrate, but now standing in the graveyard surrounding the ancient oratory'.<p>Cuppage et al/1986, 289: `The cross-slab stands at the E end of a low rectangular mound or bed of stones, including much quartz, which measures 9m E--W x 5m N--S'.</em>

The word LIE (`stone') has been read into it, but quite without justification'.<p>Cuppage et al/1986, 289: `The upper part of its W face is occupied by an equal-armed cross within a circle, the head continuing at least 5cm beyond the circle and the side arms expanding slightly where they meet the circle and projecting slightly beyond it.  The ornament beneath this does not form any recognisable pattern'.<p>Okasha/Forsyth/2001, 148: `The upper third of the face is occupied by a large equal-armed cross set in a circle. The top arm projects beyond the rim and the side arms swell at the point of intersection and continue a little beyond. Below the cross head is a vertical stem which is intersected near its foot by a long horizontal stroke. In the area above this cross-stroke, to the left and right of the stem, is a somewhat confused arrangement of curved and straight lines. Some of this was previously interpreted as part of the text'.</em>

Macalister... gave the reading:<p>COLUM MAC DINET<p>The 1st word can still be read but the other two are not clear. MAC is possible but not certain.
