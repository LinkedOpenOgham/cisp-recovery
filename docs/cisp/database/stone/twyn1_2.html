<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Westwood/1876, 158: `The stone of St. Cadvan preserved in the church of Towyn[1] is, as regards its philological elements, the most important of the ancient Welsh stones, containing on each of its four sides an inscription in the oldest form of the language of the country. It was described and figured by Dr. Taylor in 1761, and by Edward Lhwyd in Gibson's Camden, p. 622; Gough's Camden, iii. p. 172, tab. IX. figs. 1--5 ; Pennant's Wales, ii. p. 93, supp. tab. V. fig. 3, but the inscription was so inaccurately given in these works as not to be intelligible. In 1848 casts of the stone were presented to the museum at Caernarvon by W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., during the Meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in that town, who also kindly placed in my hands a series of rubbings of the stone. These materials enabled the Rev. John Williams (Ab Ithel) and myself, after many hours' labour, to prepare a memoir with figures, which appeared in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1850 (pp. 90-100), being also referred to in the Report of the Caernarvon Meeting (Arch. Camb., 1848, p. 364).<p>[1] In the Cambro-Briton, ii. p. 121, it is said at that time to decorate the grotto belonging to a gentleman who took the liberty of removing it. It subsequently stood in a field close to the road-side, about half a mile from Towyn, on the road to Dôllgellau'.<p>Macalister/1949, 167: `The monument at first stood and afterwards lay in the churchyard, from which it was removed early in the 18th century by one Dr. Taylor, and turned into a gatepost. It was afterwards restored to the church, and, when I first saw it, lay prostrate in a wooden box, which made it impossible to study any of the sides except that which happened to be uppermost. It has now been erected at the W. end of the N. aisle, so that the whole inscription can be examined with ease, except for a space of 2" on each side, concealed by an iron collar which holds the stone in an upright position. As the building is not very well lighted (or at least was not, at the time of my second visit), an electric torch is desirable'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 172: `Formerly used as a gatepost...in a field close to the road-side, about half a mile from Towyn'.</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Williams/1980, 33--40, `My attempt at the whole inscription on <em>A-D</em> is thus:	 <em>Cengrui</em> (or <em>Tengrui</em>) <em>cimalted gu(reic)</em><p>	<em>adgan</em><p>	<em>ant erunc du but marciau</em>.<p>`Ceinrwy wife of Addian (lies here) close to Bud (and) Meirchiaw.' I suggest that Bud and Meirchiaw were the children of Ceinrwy, buried before her in the same holy ground. She was laid to rest as near as possible to her dear ones.<p><em>B</em><p>On <em>B</em> Morris-Jones and others before him have read <em>CiNgeN celen</em> `Cynien's corpse.' On the stone itself, however, I read the fourth letter as a <em>b</em>, a fine example of the curving Hiberno-Saxon <em>b</em> of the <em>Book of St. Chad</em>, or the Lindisfarne Gospels. I have examined the stone on several visits, have taken rubbings of this letter, and traced every curve with my finger! It was a <em>b</em> when first seen, and it remains a <em>b</em>. I have seen it and felt it! So far as I am concerned, this <em>Cingen</em> is worse than dead: he never was.<p>	And then <em>Cinben</em> worried me much. Was the name <em>Cynfyn</em>? The <em>cinmin</em> of the <em>Book of Llan Dâv</em> and the Bodmin Manumissions with its <em>-min</em> instead of <em>-bin</em> ruled that out very definitely indeed. The solution, when it came, was simple. Sir John held that the uncial <em>N</em>'s of his <em>ciNgeN</em> favoured an earlier dating of this <em>BC</em> inscription than could be given to the one on sides <em>AD</em> with its minuscule <em>n</em>'s. (No sort of pun is intended!) He consulted Professor W. M. Lindsay on this point, and this is the expert's reply : "that an inscription with two uncial <em>n</em>'s and the remaining <em>n</em> half-uncial must be older than an inscription with all the <em>n</em>'s half-uncial is not impossible but by no means certain. For scribes found half-uncial <em>n</em> an awkward letter sometimes. In particular the combination <em>in</em> was so like <em>m</em> that some Insular scribes preferred <em>iN</em> (with uncial <em>n</em>) while others wrote <em>In</em> (with tall <em>i</em>). In short, if an uncial letter is to show its face in half-uncial script, one may expect the letter to be <em>n</em>'. [43]<p>	So N is possible in late inscriptions to save the bother of cutting an <em>n</em> with its curving second stroke. But the <em>BC</em> sculptor cut three excellent <em>n</em>'s: why then did he write <em>ciNbeN</em>? It was not for lack of skill: he revels in curves, as you can see from the illustration. 	Furthermore, the <em>Black Book of Carmarthen</em> was written five centuries later than the presumed date of our inscription; and a study of the facsimile showed quite a large number of N's, e.g. kyffrediN, vebiN, huN, eituN, GugauN, KadwallauN, prideiN, keiN, maelguN. Evidently N was a favourite for the final position! The Old Welsh boundaries in the <em>Book of LIan Dâv</em> provided similar instances, e.g. L.L., p. 173, rudlaN, 174 ceciN, hafreN, 222 bruiN, 246 ElmoiN, 255 pennicheN, 272 bronN. These lists suggested to me that we had here a possible clue to the word division on side <em>B</em> and that the <em>N</em>'s were to be taken as<p>final letters. Well, this key fitted the lock. <em>Cinben</em> dissolved into <em>Cin ben</em> very readily.<p>	One other correction in the reading had to be made. Checking up on the stone itself once more I found that the <em>in</em> in <em>Cin</em> was a ligatured UN, i.e. after cutting U the carver used the second digit of this letter as the first stroke of an uncial <em>N</em>, and added a diagonal and the second downstroke. The first word is thus CUN, and others had so taken it. To quote Morris-Jones again: `Westwood took the IN in <em>Cingen</em> to be a ligatured UN; and in Pennant's figure the bottom of the <em>I</em> is actually joined to the <em>N</em>. . . On the other hand Westwood's drawing shows no connexion, so that it seems safer to read <em>Cin</em> as Hübner does. Rhys also reads <em>Cin</em>'.[44] On the stone, I repeat, the letters <em>UN</em> are `actually joined', and we can with confidence read <em>B</em> as<p>	<em>Cun Ben Celen</em><p>followed by two crescents, to show that the inscription is not complete, and that the continuation is to be looked for elsewhere, i.e. on side <em>C</em>. I should like to point out here that <em>ben</em> is cut on a higher level than <em>cun</em>, cf. above on <em>cimalted</em>. This too is a possible sign of word division.<p>	cun. As a common noun <em>cun</em> occurs frequently in early poetry for lord or chief:[45] <em>cun</em> Gwynedd, <em>cun</em> Rheged, etc., and the well-known name <em>Cunedda</em>. Welsh <em>u</em> comes from Celtic <em>-au</em>, <em>-eu</em>, or <em>-ou</em>, when followed by a consonant, and so we can connect <em>cun</em> with such Celtic names as <em>Caunos</em>, <em>Caunae</em> (used of mountains), <em>Caunus</em>, <em>Counos</em>, a man's name; <em>Cauna</em> (<em>Caune</em>), a woman's name.[46] On the Pentrefoelas stone Macalister reads <em>Brohomagli Iatti Ic Iacit Et Uxor Eius Cavne</em>.[47] Here we have a certain Brochfael's wife called <em>Caune</em>, for <em>Caunae</em>, the genitive in the later inscriptions often replacing the nominative. Indeed, this <em>-e</em> became the usual feminine ending in Latinized Welsh names, for instance <em>hancarate</em> `Angharad'.[48] This <em>Caune</em> bore the same name in the sixth century as the Towyn lady in the eighth (or later), but the British form by then had become the Welsh <em>Cun</em>.<p>	I should like to derive <em>caun-</em>, <em>cun</em>, from the root <em>keu-</em>[49] seen in Greek kuew `I grow big'; kupios `lord'; Gaulish <em>kauaros</em>, Welsh <em>cawr</em> `champion, giant', etc.<p>	ben `wife, woman', Old Irish <em>ben</em>, Cornish <em>ben-en</em> `wife', Greek yuvn, English <em>queen</em>; Welsh <em>ben</em>-yw `female'. I know of no other instance of <em>ben</em> in Welsh, so that this is specially welcome.<p>	celen. The <em>e</em> in the final syllable, as elsewhere on this stone, is equivalent to <em>y</em> in Modern Welsh, so that <em>celen</em> corresponds to our <em>Celyn</em>, now used for `holly' only. In the medieval period it could also be used as a man's name, as for instance <em>Celyn son of Caw</em>,[50] cf. <em>Coll</em>, <em>Collen</em> `hazel', with the saint's name in Llan-<em>gollen</em>; <em>Gwern</em> `alder' and a boy's name in the Mabinogion; so also <em>Gwernen</em>; <em>Onnen</em> `ash', and a girl's name as well; <em>Eithin</em> `gorse', <em>Eithinin</em>, a warrior of the Gododdin tribe. Holder has <em>Betuus</em>, <em>Betua</em> as masculine and feminine personal names, though <em>bedw</em> is used only of the <em>birch</em> nowadays. With the diminutive ending seen in <em>Eithinin</em>, we have <em>Celynnin</em> as a man's name. There is a Llan-<em>gelynnin</em> quite close to Towyn, and it is tempting to identify the Celyn of the stone with the `little Celyn' of the church, cf. Llan<em>sadwrn</em> in Anglesey, with the <em>Saturninus</em> of the old inscription inside, `Sadyrnin'.[51] If it be argued that our Celyn had a wife and therefore could not be a saint, my answer would be that marriage might have made him one. And what of the <em>sancta coniux</em> `holy wife' of <em>Saturninus</em> commemorated at Llansadwrn? Anyhow, nothing is known of the Towyn <em>Celyn</em> and nobody can tell how many men called <em>Celyn</em> lived their lives, saintly and otherwise, in this district. Does the name, I wonder, survive in a local place name, a charter, or other early document? Later generations might easily have made a `holly bush' of his name.<p>	Early examples of <em>e</em> = <em>y</em> occur in the Juvencus englynion of the ninth century, with <em>leder</em> (llyther); <em>remedaut</em> (rhyfeddawd), <em>celmed</em> (celfydd); Ox. 1[52] <em>emedou</em>, plural of <em>emed</em> `efydd', written <em>emid</em> in <em>Martianus Capella</em>.[53] So <em>Celen</em> may be a ninth-century form of <em>celyn</em>, though <em>i</em> is the common symbol for our <em>y</em> in that period. I cannot prove that <em>e</em> was written for our <em>y</em> in the eighth; it may have been, but I have no dated document to prove that it was.<p>The rest of the epitaph is on side <em>C</em>.<p><em>C</em><p>	tricet nitanam. I wish I could translate these two words `May she rest in peace!' But Sir John is surely right[54] in taking <em>tricet</em> as a 3rd. sing. pres. indic., not a 3rd. sing. imperative `let her stay' like <em>triged</em> nowadays. In early Welsh the 3rd. pres. indic. often ends in <em>-it</em>, <em>-yt</em>,[55] when it begins a sentence, so that <em>trigyt</em> would be normal here. We have already found <em>e</em> = <em>y</em> in <em>celen</em>, so <em>tricet</em> may be for later <em>trigyt</em>, Modern Welsh <em>trig</em>. Morris-Jones translates the whole inscription `Cynien's body <em>lies beneath</em>', for he takes <em>nitanam</em> as <em>ni</em> `under': <em>tan</em> as Welsh <em>dan</em> in <em>o dan</em> `under': and <em>-am</em> as an adverbial ending.<p>	Against this interpretation one may stress the irregularity of having the long form in <em>-et</em> (<em>-yt</em>) in the middle of the sentence: and further, <em>trigo</em> to my knowledge never means `lie', but `stay, remain, dwell'. I should prefer to take [<em>lies here</em>] as something understood, and begin a new sentence with <em>tricet</em>, as the syntax demands. What that new sentence is to be, I am not so sure!<p>	At the moment my best guess is that <em>nitanam</em> may be the subject of <em>tricet</em>; it can be explained as a compound of synonyms, <em>nit</em> and <em>anam</em>. <em>Nit</em> can be the cognate of the Old Irish <em>nith</em> `a mortal wound': Modern Irish <em>nioth</em> (<em>níoth</em>, <em>nith</em>) `mortal wound, loss, affliction', so Dinneen.[56] <em>Anam</em> `anaf' (cf. Old Welsh <em>anamou</em>, gloss on <em>mendae</em>)[57] is explained by Dr. Davies as <em>mutilatio</em>,[58] by Anwyl as `blemish, defect, wound': Old Irish <em>anim</em>, Modern Irish <em>aineamh</em> `blemish, defect'; the adjective is <em>aineamhach</em> `blemished, maimed'. Combining <em>nit</em> and <em>anam</em>, we have in both elements the meaning `wound, hurt', but <em>anam</em> `anaf' stresses that it is a wound that maims : it is a <em>mutilation</em>, an essential limb has been lopped off.<p>	If <em>nid-anaf</em> is the right analysis, then <em>tnicet nit-anam</em> means `the pain, the hurt, and the sense of loss remain'. Cun has passed away, but the cruel loss remains, the mortal wound can never be healed. Such a contrast would be in keeping with all we know of Early Welsh poetry: the primitive bards, the <em>Cynfeirdd</em> and <em>Gogynfeirdd</em>, delighted in such contrasts, which they expressed with masterly brevity and force. The compound noun and compound adjective were an integral part of their technique. No chieftain's household in the old days was complete without a bard: in Celyn's hail there was, I think, a true poet.<p>	I read the whole inscription on <em>B-C</em> then as<p>	<em>cun ben celen : tricet nitanam</em><p>	Cun, wife of Celyn : grief and loss remain.<p>THE `FOOTNOTES'.<p>	The two main inscriptions are thus fairly straightforward. Two `footnotes'---if I may. use the word---were added, one on <em>A</em> and one on <em>C</em>, both at the foot of the pillar. Though <em>A</em> is certainly the earlier, that on <em>C</em> must be tackled first, for a correct interpretation of it is essential, if we are to make sense of the cryptic letters on <em>A</em>.<p>	The <em>C</em> footnote is nicely cut in rounded lettering...Then follow<p>	mozt<p>	cicpe<p>	tuar<p>Rhys read this as <em>moltcic petuar</em>.[59] The last word is obviously Old Welsh for <em>pedwar</em> `four', and he took the <em>molt</em> he saw in the first line to be <em>mollt</em> `a sheep' and <em>cic</em> in the second to be <em>cig</em> `meat, flesh'. Combining the two, he evolved his <em>molltgig</em>, `which means either "the mutton flesh of four", or "a wether (is) flesh of or for four"'. He goes on: `I need hardly say that I have considerable misgivings as to this stone. Perhaps inscriptions 1 and 2 (= <em>B</em> and <em>A</em>) are genuine; but I can hardly think the rest is so, or divine its meaning. The former may have served as models for the lettering of the rest.' The `mutton flesh' evidently disagreed with him -- and no wonder.<p>	Morris-Jones read <em>mol</em>, and identified this with <em>moll</em> in an obscure poem in the <em>Black Book of Carmarthen</em>,[60] which he thought might mean `tomb'. He then took the following <em>t</em> to be the initial of <em>Tegryn</em> (<em>tengrui</em>), <em>c</em> the initial of <em>Cynien</em> (his <em>cingen</em>), the <em>i</em> as <em>7</em>, the symbol for <em>et</em> `and', and the following <em>c</em> as <em>ceteri</em>. His interpretation of the whole is `the tomb of Tegryn, Cynien, et ceteri four (and four others)'. `The four others would be <em>Malted</em>, <em>Guadgan</em>, <em>Dubut</em>, and <em>Marciaun</em>, leaving <em>anterunc</em> as a connective.'[61]<p>	I challenge the reading <em>molt</em>. The third letter is not an <em>l</em> but the <em>r</em> found in early MSS. after round-backed letters like <em>o</em>. The first element of <em>R</em> was a curving downstroke, and the scribes, in order to save space occasionally made use of the last curves of <em>o</em> and similar letters as the first element in <em>R</em>, and added what was left of the <em>R</em> (closely resembling the figure 2). I suggest that the author of this footnote wrote <em>02</em> (=<em>or</em>) in the copy he made for the stone cutter. What the latter made of it was <em>o</em> and something which looks like <em>z</em>. Rhys indeed remarks that the <em>I</em> on the stone has become `almost a <em>z</em> in the word <em>molt</em>'. If he had only recognized this <em>z</em> as the <em>r</em> symbol, he would have been rid of his `mutton for four', and his misgivings about the authenticity of the inscription. Lindsay, in his <em>Early Welsh Script</em>, has a facsimile of the Cambridge Univ. Lib. Ff. 4.42, Juvencus (dated ninth century by Bradshaw),[62] Plate VI, p. 51. You will see there a good example of the <em>r</em> symbol (mentioned above) at the end of line 7, <em>cruore</em>. Plate VII gives the top of the first folio of this MS.; the third line from the bottom begins <em>comorat</em>: after the <em>o</em> here too we get a fine example of this <em>r</em>. On the <em>Martianus Capella</em>, dated the end of the ninth century, Lindsay remarks, `The by-form of <em>r</em> normal after <em>o</em> (really a majuscule <em>r</em> without the shaft) is used not only after <em>o</em> but after <em>e</em> in this MS.' He notes this as favouring a later date, not mid-ninth but late ninth century.[63] In our inscription, the <em>r</em> `normal after <em>o</em>' occurs in <em>mort</em>. How early this <em>r</em> was introduced, I cannot tell. The Juvencus was written about 850, and we started with a vague idea that the lettering of the Towyn inscriptions suggested a date about 750.<p>	mort cic or mortcic. The <em>t</em> stands for <em>th</em> (cf. <em>c=ch</em> in <em>marciau</em> above). After <em>r</em> in Welsh <em>t</em> and <em>c</em> are aspirated, becoming <em>th</em>, <em>ch</em>. The final <em>c</em> corresponds to modern <em>g</em> as a rule in our early documents, but in the <em>Book of Llan Dâv</em> <em>-c</em> sometimes varies with <em>ng</em>. Archenfield in Herefordshire (<em>Ariconium</em>) is given in Welsh as <em>Ergin</em>, <em>Ercic</em>, <em>Ergic</em>, <em>Ercicg</em>, and <em>Ercig</em>.[64] So <em>mortcic</em> may be <em>morthgig</em> in later Welsh, or <em>morthging</em>, or <em>morthgin</em>. Or even <em>mort c.x</em> (for <em>crux</em> !).<p>	I hope to deal with <em>mortcic</em> in full later on, so I will only say this now, <em>mort</em> may be connected with Latin <em>mort-</em> `death' (<em>mors</em>, <em>mortis</em>, <em>mortuus</em>), or be from the same root as <em>mor</em> in Latin <em>memor</em>; <em>morthcin(g)</em> could be a borrowing from Latin <em>morticina</em>;[65] <em>cic</em> may be <em>cig</em> `flesh', or the <em>cing</em> in <em>gweilging</em>, <em>perging</em>, <em>Erging</em>. This bunch of linguistic problems calls for a very full, detailed (and boring) discussion, which we can postpone until another day. So I shall content myself now with just giving my opinion, that <em>mort cic</em> must mean either `death pillar' or `memorial stone', or `mortal remains', and with your permission I shall use <em>memorial</em> for it--until another example turns up on vellum or stone, to correct me.<p>So I read <em>mortcic petuar</em> as `the memorial of four', viz. <em>Ceinrwy</em>, <em>Bud</em>, <em>Meirchiaw</em>, and <em>Cun</em>. Now, we can go back to the untidy footnote on <em>A</em>. This, with the help of Lhwyd's drawings, can be read<p>	mc<p>	Ertri<p>The <em>mc</em> is certain. The first letter of line 2 looks to me like an uncial E with the mid-horizontal used as part of a following <em>r</em> (<em>er</em> ligatured), but it may be <em>a</em> ; so <em>Er</em> or<em> Ar</em>. Then <em>t</em> from Lhwyd's copy: the curve at the bottom of the downstroke is all that remains of it, beyond the break in the stone. Then <em>r</em> is clear. After that I see a faint <em>i</em>. These letters are of the same type as those in the main <em>A</em> inscription; and are as badly arranged as the rest.<p>	It has been suggested above that <em>gu</em> on this <em>A</em> face is an abbreviation or suspension of <em>gureic</em>. I am quite convinced that the cryptic <em>mc</em> too is a similar abbreviation of <em>mort cic</em>, the compound you have permitted me to translate for the nonce as <em>memorial</em>.<p>	If <em>ertri</em> be read, the <em>er</em> can stand for the definite article, usually written <em>ir</em> in Old Welsh (even before consonants), our <em>yr</em> (with the <em>r</em> dropped before consonants). If <em>artri</em> be read, <em>ar</em> too maybe a variant of <em>er</em> (<em>yr</em>) ; cf. above on the <em>ant</em> (=<em>ynt</em>) in <em>anterunc</em>, and on <em>e</em> =<em>y</em> in <em>celen</em>.<p>	<em>tri</em> is our <em>tri</em> `three'. And so the meaning of the <em>A</em> footnote whether we read <em>mc er tri</em>, or <em>mc ar tri</em>, is `This is a memorial of the three', viz. <em>Ceinrwy</em>, <em>Bud</em>, and <em>Meirchiaw</em>.<p>	Why was it added? Was it because the <em>A</em> sculptor found that he had left out the conjunction <em>ac</em> `and' after <em>But</em>? He wanted to make it quite clear that this was a memorial of the THREE, hence the postscript, untidy, but well-meant, After Cun's burial, the second craftsman had no option : he had to-cut in his turn another footnote to emphasize that the <em>mortcic</em> was now the memorial of <em>four</em>, not of <em>three</em>. The two footnotes supplement one another, and the later helps to explain the earlier: <em>mc er tri</em> `a memorial of the three'; <em>mort cic petuar</em> `a memorial of four'.'</em>
