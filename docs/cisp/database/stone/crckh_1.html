<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Brash/1871a, 158--162: `Being desirous of making a personal examination of the Ogham inscribed stones of Wales, I was enabled to gratify my curiousity in the autumn of the past year...On my visit to that place, I found the greatest difficulty in finding its whereabouts...[for] it had been removed from the place of its original location, stated to be on the farm of Ty yn y wlad, off the road between Crickhowel and Lanbehr, to Glenusk Park, the residence of Sir Joseph Bailey, M.P., about two miles from Crickhowel. Proceeding to that place, I had the satisfaction of seeing it at last, standing about half way up the avenue, on the right hand-side, under a clump of trees...Having written to Sir Joseph Bailey some inquiries respecting the removal of the monument, he has kindly sent me the following information, that the stone was not on the farm of Ty yn y wlad, as stated by Jones and others, but on a farm of his own called Wern y Butler, adjoining the former; that it was placed as a foot-stone across a ditch, and in that position was entirely neglected, and hourly subjected to injury. Seeing the archaeological value of the monument, and its precarious and neglected position, he considered it prudent to place it in a position of safety by removing it to Glenusk Park'.<p>Westwood/1876, 73--74: `In 1846 I visited the farm of Wern-y-Butler, where the stone then was, and it was impossible to have discovered it had I not been accompanied by the proprietor of the farm, as it was completely overgrown with brambles, and the plough having cast earth up around it on which grass and moss had grown in profusion. The stone had even then been removed from its former position in an adjoining field on the farm of Ty-yn-y-wlâd...About ten years ago the stone was removed from its former situation to Glan Usk Park, the residence of Sir Joseph Bailey, M.P., about two miles west of Crickhowell, where it now stands in the midst of a small clump of trees about three furlongs to the east of his house, and where it was visited by the members of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at the Brecon Meeting in 1872, and again at the Abergavenny Meeting in 1876, when they were most hospitably received by Sir Joseph Bailey'.<p>Macalister/1945, 314: `In 1774 this stone was lying prostrate by the side of a ploughed field on the farm of Ty'n y Wlad, Crickhowel (Crug Hywel), and there overgrown with brambles...It was later removed to the garden of Glan Usk Park, close by where it now stands'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 69: `The stone stood in Glanusk Park until removed to Brecknock Museum (in 1948).  Cast No. 06.482'.</em>

This cannot be accidental: the word must surely mean `boy' in the sense of `attendant' rather than of `son''.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Brash/1871a, 160, provides a long discussion as to why the fourth character, a cross (I-forfid) should be regarded as a consonant rather than the dipthong AE which is the meaning given by the <em>Book of Ballymote</em>.<p>Westwood/1876, 74: `With respect to the Oghamic marks, Messrs. T. Wright and C. Roach Smith (Journ. Brit. Arch. Association, Feb. 1847) suggest that the stone has been chipped along this edge, and that the marks which remain are portions of a series of numerals giving the age of the deceased. In the Archaeologia Cambrensis (1869, p. 153) Mr. Brash clearly proved these marks to be Oghams, but his figure of them in p. 154 by no means corresponds with the true position and form of the marks. These he partially corrected in his article on this stone (Arch. Camb., 1871, p. 158), showing that the marks on the stone, reading upwards from the bottom (and which are reproduced in the lower row of outlines in my plate as far upwards as the letter R in TRILVNI), clearly represent the Oghamic characters for the word TVRPILI...It is surprising that Mr. Brash overlooked the Ogham marks at the top of the stone terminating, or rather commencing, opposite the P at the beginning of the second line. These are added on my plate at the left-hand end of the stone from sketches and rubbings by myself and Mr. Robinson of Cardiff, one of the Secretaries of the Cambrian Archaeological Association. Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 19) gives these upper marks as equivalent to Lluni, the remains of Trilluni, which occurs as Triluni in the Roman letters'.<p>Macalister/1945, 315--316: `The first four letters are quite clear, the P being represented by a simplified form of the I-forfid. The first three notches of the following I are broken away. There is only one L, though a fracture on the surface preceding it might be mistaken for a second L. The first two notches of the following I remain, the other three being quite abraded. Of the surviving notches, one is oblique and appears to be longer than the ordinary notches, so it might be mistaken for an ordinary M; it is not however, really longer than the vowel notches in the beginning of the inscription. After this, nothing is clear but LL..N, followed by three vowel notches, at the top of the stone. The two L's are crowded together and certainly would have been taken for an S if we had not the corrective guidance of the Roman TRILINI. The vowel between the L's and the N is gone: there is hardly room for U, and it most probably was an O. The top of the stone is broken carrying with it the two final notches of the final I. If there was ever anything in the Ogham corresponding to the concluding DVNOCATI of the Roman [CRCKH/1/2], it is altogether broken away: almost the whole back of the stone has become detached over a cleavage-plane, and it is quite possible that the completion of the inscription may thus have been lost.<p>Returning now to the space following TURPILI... the edge is almost worn smooth, but on minute examination the following traces can be detected:--<p>1. The B-half of an M, between the TR of the Roman TRILVNI.<p>2. An S, in line with the R of PVVERI.<p>3. The first and last scores of a C, in line respectively with the outer tips of the horizontal bars of the E of PVVERI, and with the vertical bar of the same letter.<p>4. The T of T[RA]LLONI, in line with the second V of PVVERI. Nothing remains of the R which should follow; it must have filled up so much of the available space that it would have been impossible to crowd in the five notches of an I. There is hardly room for more than the one notch of an A.<p>These traces are sufficient to enable us to fill in the inscription, as set forth above'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Legibility:</strong><td>poor<br>Westwood/1876, 73, notes that many earlier authors had not believed that the marks on the left hand edge of the stone were ogham -- the first author to correctly discuss them being Brash (Rolt-Brash/1869) who then discussed them more fully in 1871 (Rolt-Brash/1871) at which time he offered a reading for the start of the inscription.  Westwood goes on to note that it was surprising that Brash had missed the oghams near the top of the stone thought by Rhys (Rhys/1874) to represent LLUNI.<p>Macalister/1945, 314: `The letters were well cut, not pocked, and in broad lines: but they are much weathered, and the middle part of the ogham is almost effaced, presumably by cattle wear'.</em>

Brash/1871a, 160: `The name of the individual commemorated on this stone, though of Gaedhelic type, I have not been able to identify in its present form of TURPIL. Names with the prefix Tor or Tur (as these vowels are commutable in Gaedhelic), are very unusual, as TORBACH, TURLOGH, TURCAN, TORPAD, TORPTHA (<em>Annals</em> 4 <em>Masters</em>). The word TOR in Gaedhelic signifies a prince or head chief'. Jackson/1953, 184: `Here <em>rp</em> [in TURPILI] had not yet become <em>rf</em> in British, as the Ogam perhaps shows; though if it had, and if <em>rp</em> was still <em>written</em> in British Latin, the Ogam might be a mere transliteration. In any case the engraver used the <em>forfid</em>, "additional symbol", which had been devised for <em>p</em> in Ogam, as a sound which did not exist in Primitive Irish, subsequently to the invention of the Ogam alphabet. Perhaps this letter was first used in Britain for the very purpose of writing British and Latin names'.</em>
