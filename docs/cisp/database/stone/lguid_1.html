<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 218--219: `This stone was discovered by Keranflec'h, built into the enclosing wall of a threshing area in the hamlet of Kervily, Languidic [Keranflec'h/1858, 335]. His illustration of the stone in this position, reproduced by La Borderie, shows it apparently standing on top of the ground and thus complete.<p>The stone was seen by Rosenzweig in the 1860s but when Louis Marsille went to Kervily in search of it in 1936 he could not find the wall nor the stone and there was no local memory of it. A little over a decade later H. F. Buffet, Archivist of Ille-et-Vilaine, noticed an inscribed stone on private ground at Locmalo, Port-Louis, 25km to the south west of Kervily. He alerted Marsille, who identified it as the missing stone. It was subsequently discovered that Dominique Marquet, mayor of the commune of Port-Louis from 1880 to 1890, had moved the stone from Kervily to his property at Kerso, Port-Louis. Château de Kerso is now a ruin but the stone is still standing in its grounds.<p>The stone at Kerso, and the original site, were visited by members of the CISP team in May 1997 and the original site in June 1999'.</em>

It currently stands 162cm above ground level but Rosenzweig gives its total length as c.2m. This is consistent with the drawing by Keranflec'h, which reveals about 25% more of the stone's length than is now visible above ground. The pillar is sub-rectangular in section. The inscribed east (strictly ESE) face is 48cm broad, the west face 44cm, the north and south faces 53cm and 56cm respectively. The top is gently rounded. The four faces are flat and smooth and meet each other at crisp angles; the whole is very regular in both shape and finish'.</em>

The carving is sharp and well preserved: there is some lichen on the stone but not much active erosion, despite its sea-side location (the inscribed face looks away from the sea).<p>The cross is crisply carved in false relief, the cross head being about 43.5cm high and 43cm across. The straight-sided wedge-shaped arms taper on the right and at the bottom from about 19cm at the outside to 3-3.5cm, and on the left and at the top from 15-15.5cm to 3-3.5cm, where they meet the central disc (diameter c.9.5cm), which has a small circular depression. The cross stands on a straight-sided shaft, about 14cm wide and 78.5cm long, which meets the lower arms of the cross in two small circular indentations'.</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 217--18: `CROX. This shows the same Brittonic development of Latin CRUX as found at Langombrac'h [LDAUL/1], discussed in that entry above. ...<p>IB has few suitable parallels. <em>Ibiau</em> was an OB woman's name in the early 9th century. Names in <em>-iau</em> are generally pet names, formed by adding <em>-iau</em> to the first element of a compound name. For example, OW <em>T'eliau</em> is a secondary pet form for the saint otherwise known as <em>El-iud</em>. Therefore, the occurrence of the form <em>Ibiau</em> would point to the existence of <em>Ib-</em> as a personal name element, perhaps specifically used for females. However, in the present case, the syntax of the inscription does not support the presence of a second personal name. Alternatively, <em>ib</em> might be an abbreviation for Latin <em>ibi</em>, 'there', substituted for or confused with the more usual <em>hic</em> `here'.<p>Another suggestion is that B could have been carved in error for D, reading i<d> with an implied <em>est</em> and meaning `The cross of Heranbili, that (is) the son of Heranal'. <em>Id est</em> is found in a 7th-century inscription from Narbonne and a 5th- or 6th-century inscription from Whithorn in southern Scotland'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 217: `The inscription is in Insular half-uncial. This is indicated by the half-uncial and open form of the Rs, the wedge-shaped finials on some of the ascenders, such as the final L and the initial H of line 2, and the form of the As. Other letters include minuscule H, H-shaped N, minuscule B and the `wayward' X. There are two forms of E, one very rounded and uncial, the other less rounded but perhaps still an attempt at the uncial form. The F has a rounded top stroke that extends almost to the cross-bar, which is itself slightly elongated with an upturn at its end. This form is close to, but should not be confused with, a `horizontal' R. <p>The script used on this stone is very similar to that found at Crac'h [CRACH/1]: the H, N, R, A, and the occasional wedge-shaped finial are common to both inscriptions. It seems likely, therefore, on palaeographic grounds alone, that this inscription dates to much the same period, that is the 7th or 8th century'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 217--218: `HAREN-, HERAN-. Since it looks as if this inscription commemorates members of the same family as the individuals named on the stone of Crac'h (1) [CRACH/1], it is also likely that the initial name element is the same, spelled variously <em>Herann-</em> and <em>Hera[n]-</em> at Crac'h and <em>Haren-</em> and <em>Heran-</em> here. Therefore <em>Haren-</em> is the odd spelling and perhaps reflects the unaccented form of the word, OB <em>Iarn-</em>. These four instances also increase the likelihood that <em>-an(n)-</em> is inherent in the root, rather than a suffix or a second word. Hence, as proposed above [CRACH/1], it probably means `iron', more commonly spelled <em>Iarn-</em> and <em>hoiarn</em> in OB names, but with a wide range of variants.<p>HARENBILI. <em>Bili</em> is abundantly attested as a single-element OB name in the 9th and 11th centuries. The common OW name <em>Beli</em> is probably the same. In OB sources, <em>-bili</em> often occurs as the second element of compound names, in which case it is often spelled <em>-uili</em>, reflecting lenition: e.g. <em>Con-uili</em>, <em>Rat-uili</em>'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 179--180: `[For the HERAN(N) element see the entry for the name <em>Herannuen</em>] (H)AL. The suffix or second element of the father's name is less certain. There are several Neo-Brittonic words <em>al</em> or <em>hal</em>. As orthographic features, both mute <em>h-</em> and failure to write phonetic <em>h-</em> are found (cf. <em>Abrinum</em> `Severn' in the Life of Saint Samson, i.40 (ed. Flobert/1997: 204)). Deciding between <em>Heranal</em> and <em>Heranhal</em> is accordingly difficult'.</em>
