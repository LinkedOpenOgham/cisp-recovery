C, head 10e, r5<br>Westwood/1879, 100, 103: `Height from the surface of the ground to the top of the shaft, 10 feet; narrowed top of the shaft, 10 inches; height of the cross, 2 feet and 1/2 an inch; breadth of the shaft at the base, 2 feet 3 inches; in the middle, 2 feet; at the top, 22 inches; width of the cross, 2 feet and 1/2 an inch. The shaft is formed of a squared block of stone, the base having a slightly widened portion, and the top narrowed obliquely on the west face; the north and south sides are not quite so wide as the east and west faces...The west side of the Nevern cross was very inaccurately figured in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association, vol. i. p. 145. The west side was first figured by myself in Journ. Arch. Institute, 1846, p. 71, vol. iii, and Proceed. Oxford Archit. Society, May 15, 1861, and all the sides in my memoir in Arch. Cambrensis, 1860, p. 48. It is formed of a single stone, except the cross at the top, which had formerly been fixed with an iron spike. The shaft is 10 feet long, but, according to the parish clerk, it is buried six feet in the earth; the cross at the top is 2 feet 10 1/2 inches high. In the first-mentioned work, vol. i. p. 320, the Rev. J.

This vulgar tale, although it concern in some sort church matters, you may either believe or not without peril of damnation.'' ' (p. 542.)'</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong><a href="../manual/node3.html#decorX" target=manual class=man>Decorations:</a></strong><td>boss; frame; geometric ribbon interlace; geometric key pattern<p>Westwood/1879, 100--103: `The ornamentation of the four sides of this cross is of that kind to which the term Runic knots and circles has been perpetually misapplied. It is however not of Scandinavian but of Celtic origin, and is found in all the earliest Christian British and Irish monuments, both of stone and metal, as well as in MSS. That it does occur indeed on some stone monuments with Runic inscriptions in the Isle of Man and elsewhere is true, but it nowhere occurs in Scandinavia, nor in Teutonic countries, and therefore, as indeed historic records prove, its occurrence with Runic inscriptions is due to Scandinavian visitors adopting the ornamentation with the religion of the country they resorted to. <p>It will be seen from the engraving that the shaft of the cross consists on each side of a series of compartments, each containing a differently arranged interlaced ribbon or other characteristic pattern; thus resembling the ornamented shaft of some of the gigantic initial letters in the early MSS. of the Gospels above alluded to, which may indeed be said almost truly to represent the shafts of these great crosses reduced to the size of a miniature, thus proving the identity of the workmanship as well as of the workmen by whom both classes of monuments were executed. <p>Taking the representations of the Nevern cross as they occur in the accompanying plate, it will be seen that in addition to the endless variety of the interlaced ribbon patterns (each ribbon having an incised line running along its centre), the south side has at its base a raised pattern of classical design resembling the Grecian fret, of which a better specimen occurs at the top of the west side. Above this fret on the south side is a curious diagonal pattern formed of narrow raised and angulated lines, the general effect produced being that of a St. Andrew's cross with the spaces between the arms filled in with four pairs of incised T's placed obliquely, with the tops of each pair placed in opposition to each other. This is also the character of the bottom compartment on the east side, except that here only one-fourth of the pattern is represented, and consequently there is only one pair of T's similarly placed, with raised knobs in the open spaces. It will be seen that if the pattern on the south side were to be doubled or quadrupled the oblique T's would form a series of X's, giving somewhat of the character of the curious pattern in the compartment on the east side above the inscription[1]. These diagonal patterns have very much of a Chinese character about them, as is also especially the case with the compartment above the inscription on the west side, and that at the bottom of the north side, where four T's are so arranged as to form a series of steps in the spaces between the letters. The pattern at the bottom of the west side is another modification of these diagonal designs, and is of common occurrence on the Llantwit and other early decorated stones. <p>The head of the cross is of elegant proportions, the four arms of equal size, short, widened at the ends, with the spaces between the arms sunk, the depressed parts with a raised boss in the centre of each, as is also the case with the centre of the cross itself, which is ornamented with an interlaced ribbon pattern, as is also the narrowed space at the base of the cross.<p>[1] A curious error of the sculptor in this pattern will he noticed, the upper fil-fot cross having the angulated end of its left upper arm reversed. The ingenious manner in which the adjoining ornament has been modified will be observed'.<p>Macalister/1949, 172: `The whole surface is covered with panels containing key-patterns and interlacements, rather clumsily designed and coarsely drawn: they are pocked on the face of the stone and rubbed smooth'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 199--200: `<em>Front</em>. The cross-head is filled with two double-beaded two-cord twists intercrossing in the centre and terminating in double-beaded triquetra-knots filling the arm-ends, a type of decorative treatment found on the later Scandinavian crosses in the I. of Man.[1] The neck below bears a square panel containing a pair of interlinked double-beaded oval rings, flanked by two small opposed quadrant-shaped panels filling the rounded `shoulders'. The decoration of the shaft is in panels disposed vertically: (a) eight-cord double-beaded plait; (b) double vertical band of swastika key-pattern; (c) small transverse panel containing an inscription in two lines reading horizontally (see below); (d) double-beaded loop-pattern (but based on an eight-cord plait), similar to that used on No. 303; (e) large square of diaper key-pattern with interspersed pellets regularly disposed. <em>Right</em>. The arm-end of the cross-head is filled with a short vertical band of square fret. The neck is plain; the shoulder bears a quadruple triangular knot. The decoration of the shaft is in panels disposed vertically: (a) irregular six-cord double-beaded knotwork embodying the Stafford-knot; (b) six-cord double-beaded plait; (c) eight-cord double-beaded plait with irregular breaks; (d) double vertical band of double-beaded swastika T-frets. <em>Back</em>. The cross-head is filled with four double-beaded Stafford-knots in the arm-ends interjoined by open two-cord double-beaded strands around a small central boss, in the manner of the Northumbrian crosses.[2] The decoration of the neck and shoulders is the same as in front. The patterns filling the shaft are in panels disposed vertically: (a) short transverse band of double-beaded square fret; (b) short transverse panel of four-cord double-beaded plait; (c) double vertical band of conjoined double-beaded swastika T-frets (d) transverse panel containing an inscription in one line reading horizontally (see below); (e) large double-beaded double Stafford-knot; (f) double vertical band of diaper key-pattern. <em>Left</em>. The arm-end of the cross-head is filled with a vertical band of double-beaded square fret-pattern or angular twist. The neck below is plain. The shoulder bears a quadruple triangular knot. The decoration of the shaft is in panels disposed vertically: (a) irregular four-cord double-beaded knotwork embodying the Stafford-knot; (b) irregular six-cord double-beaded knotwork embodying the ring-twist; (c) irregular six-cord double-beaded knotwork merging below into vertical twists; (d) double vertical band of diaper key-pattern; (e) short transverse band of square fret...The monument belongs to the same group as Nos. 159, 222, and 303. Its decoration is closely similar in style to that of No. 303, and there is the same clumsiness of form, suggesting that the two are more or less contemporary.<p>[1] <em>MC</em>, [Kermode/1909] p. 42. <p>[2] ... The same style appears also in Cornwall. See 0CC, [Langdon/1896] p. 364 (Sancreed, no. 4)'.</em>

Macalister/1949, 172: `This would be a mispelling of <em>Owain</em>. There is (as Sir John Lloyd has pointed out to me) some difficulty about the identification of the latter name with <em>Eugein</em>, owing to the absence of the <em>g</em>, which we should expect in an inscription of so apparently early a date: but it may possibly show that even already the <em>g</em> was degenerating into an orthographical tradition, and in the phonetic spelling of the not very highly accomplished artist of the Nevern cross was ignored'.</em>
