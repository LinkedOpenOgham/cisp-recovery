<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>NMRS/NT24SE8, states that the stone `probably originally stood in a graveyard on the site of the Cross Kirk...[it[ was discovered in November 1967, built into a retaining wall at the rear of the public garden immediately W of St Andrew's Church (NT 250 405). Until 1932, it was built into a tenement wall there, which was demolished in that year. It has now been removed and is on display in the Chambers Institution, Peebles [i.e. Peebles Museum]'.<p>CISP: The stone was stolen from display in Peebles Museum in the late 1970s or early 1980s. A decade later it was anonymously returned.<p>Steer/1969, 127: `In November 1967, a few months after the publication of the Royal Commission's <em>Inventory of Peebleshire</em>, Mr I. C. Lawson, the Secretary of the newly formed Tweedale Society, drew the writer's attention to an inscribed stone which at that time was built into a retaining wall at the rear of the small public garden that fronts on to the street known as Old Town, within the burgh of Peebles, immediately to the west of St Andrew's (Church of Scotland) Church. Although Mr Lawson had been aware of the existence of this stone since childhood, no record of it seems to have been published; and at the time when the burgh was being surveyed by the Comission's staff it was screened from view by a vigorous contoneaster shrub. ...The likelihood is that it originally stood in a graveyard on the site of the cross Kirk, Peebles, but scarcely anything is known about its subsequent history. Mr Lawson's father recalls, however, that until 1932 it was incorporated in the wall of a tenement property which occupied the site of the present garden, and which was demolished in that year in order to allow the road to be widened. The tenement was erected about 1780, and the stone may have been built into the fabric at the outset, for although the walls of the cross Kirk itself were left untouched for some years after the building was abandoned in 1784, the adjoining claustral buildings, which probably overlay part of the ancient graveyard, were being used as a quarry for building material from the seventeenth century onwards'.</em>

Steer/1968-69, 128: `Neitan is a native British (ie. Brittonic anmd Pictish), and not an Anglian name, equivalent to the Irish Nechtan, while the weakening of the second declension nominative ending <em>-us</em> to <em>-o</em> is paralleled in both British and Gallic inscriptions of the period'.</em>
