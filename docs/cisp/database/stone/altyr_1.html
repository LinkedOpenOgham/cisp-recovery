<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>recognised, 1839 Rhind, W.
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Forsyth/1996, 23, records that the stone currently stands `surrounded by a wooden fence in a field by the drive from Altyre House to Forres, in the parish of Rafford Moray (NGR NJ 0391 5537)', but that its earlier placement was unclear. Forsyth cites an earlier suggestion (Calder & Moray/1957, 246) that the stone was brought to  its current site c.1820 from `somewhere in the Laigh of  Moray'. <p>Forsyth/1996, 24, does, however, also make clear that Williams Rhind, in 1839, was the first to notice the carvings on the stone. These were not identified as ogham until the twentieth century. In his copy of Allen/Anderson/1903 Graham Callander, Keeper of the National Museum of Scotland from 1919-1938 wrote the marginal note `this stone has an ogham inscription'. This suggestion was followed up by R.B.K. Stevenson, and the stone was analysed and published by Sir William Calder and K.H. Jackson in 1957.</em>

The shaft is of the same thickness as the arms and the stepped hollows creates the impression of a square panel at the cross-head. The form was a popular one on Pictish cross-slabs, particularly among later slabs and is seen elsewhere north of the Mounth at Skinnet CAT, Edderton and Nigg ROS...The background is too pitted to rule out the possibility that it might have been decorated with geometric or figurative work, but there is no trace of any such carving. If the slab was indeed plain it would be unique in such a grand monument'.</em>
