They appear to me to represent the name<p>+ artbeu. <p>Respecting the second of these letters, which might be thought the most difficult to be deciphered, I have not the least doubt that it is intended for a r, which in many of our earliest manuscripts has the first stroke elongated below the line, and the second stroke deflexed, sometimes even so much as to resemble a [*]; the fourth letter appears to be a b, and the last a u of unusual form. Although I was unable to make a rubbing of the stone I was enabled to make a clear drawing of it, the letters having been well brought out by the sunlight, and which has since been fully confirmed by the examination of a rubbing made by the Rev. H. L. Jones...The inscription with the cross extends to the length of 24 inches, the average height of the letters being 3 inches'.<p>Anon/1901, 61: `The inscription is in rudely formed Hiberno-Saxon minuscule letters, of the seventh to ninth century'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 157: `Round half-uncials'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 40: `The inscription in regular half-uncials read down the length of the face consists of the one word ARTBEU, the name of the person commemorated'.</em>

Jackson/1953, 283, 373, 572, discusses the name stating it gives Wlesh <em>Arthfyw</em> and that the spelling -EU is for Late British <em>-iu-</em>. Westwood/1879, 5--6, `As to the person intended to be commemorated in this inscription, we may notice first that he was a Christian, as shewn by the sacred emblem prefixed to his name; and secondly that the inscription from the form of the letters must have been executed long after the departure of the Romans. Mr. Stephens, indeed, at the Meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1853, in a paper on the Antiquities of Merthyr and its neighbourhood published in the Fourth Volume of Archaeologia Cambrensis for that year (Ser. 2. vol. iv. p. 319), gives it as his opinion that it commemorates Arthen, a brother of St. Tydfil. The Rev. W. Basil Jones, now Bishop of St. David's, on the other hand, suggested that although Artgen or Arthen was the son of Brychan Brycheiniog, a name famous in Brecknockshire (but regarded as apocryphal by him and most other archaeologists), there were others of the same name, and hence that it is doubtful whether it were intended for the individual in question. The fact however that this stone should even still be found forming part of St. Tydfil's Church (having probably been placed there when the former church was destroyed), is in favour of Mr. Stephens' suggestion...Artgen occurs among the legendary sons of Brychan. Artgen, prince of Ceredigion, died A.D. 807 (Ann. Camb. and Brut y Tywysog.). And Arthgen, son of Sulien Bishop of St. David's, must have died a few years before or after A. D. 1100. The date seems to exclude the first (supposing him to have existed), and the locality the second, whilst the assumed date of the monument is inconsistent with the third. Sulien's other sons appear to have left St. David's on their brother Rhyddmarch's death, so that Arthgen may well have died in Glamorgan. Haddan and Stubbs' Councils, i. p. 631'.<p>Anon/1901, 61: `The name is not found elsewhere in Wales, but occurs in the <em>Cartulaire de Redon</em> in the following forms: Arthbiu, Arthueu, Arthuiu'.</em>
