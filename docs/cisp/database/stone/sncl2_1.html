<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>first mentioned, 1810 Fenton
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Westwood/1856, 49: `The first of the accompanying engravings represents a stone which, in its present state, would present great difficulty in any attempt to decipher it; but it fortunately happens that an engraving of it, before it was broken and a portion of it lost, was given by Mr. Fenton in his <em>History of Pembrokeshire, p. 28</em>. The stone was, at the time of the publication of that work, used as a stile in the hedge of the churchyard at St. Nicholas, in that county, and I believe that (notwithstanding the sacred emblem upon its face, which one would have thought sufficient to have preserved it from descration) it still remains in its desecrated position'.<p>Rhys/1873, 6: `Aug. 16. --...St. Nicholas, about three miles from Mathry in the direction of Fishguard. The stone we wished to see has recently been placed in the wall of the churchyard'.<p>Westwood/1879, 126, quotes the passage from Westwood/1860, cited above, almost verbatim, omitting the last sentence.<p>Allen/1896, 292: `Formerly used as a stile in the hedge of the churchyard; and now built into the wall of the churchyard'.<p>Rhys/1905, 85: `The stone is in the church'.<p>RCAHMW/1925, 379: `Formerly in the churchyard wall (Lhuyd says `on the east side of the porch'), but now fixed against the chancel wall'.<p>Macalister/1945, 428, `...formerly in the churchyard wall, where the letters were partly hidden, but now built into a pier of the church, facing the Communion table.'</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Latin (rcaps)
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Westwood/1856, 49--50: `The only remaining difficulty will then rest upon the first word TUNC, to be treated either as an adverb or as the commencement of the female name CETACE. In the former view the unusual character of the formula may be matched by the word IAM in the Brochmael inscription...the latter view may perhaps be supported by the discovery of some female name in the early records of Wales...The cross inscribed on the stone would appear to be even more ancient than the inscription, as the letter H in the second line has its second stroke shortened to prevent it from running into the left arm of the cross. Possibly this circumstance may throw a little light upon the employment of the adverb TUNC in the present case'.<p>Rhys/1873, 6: `the attempt to reduce TVNC, taken to be the Latin adverb, to a compatibility of tense with IACIT, is quite uncalled for'.<p>Rhys/1905, 86, provides extensive linguistic comment in terms of the metre of the inscription.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Westwood/1856, 49--50: `The extent of the fracture may be judged from the word <em>Hic</em> at the end of the second line and the syllable <em>cit</em> at the beginning of the third line, showing that the two letters <em>ja</em>, being the commencement of the word <em>jacit</em>, are now lost, and the same number of letters are lost at the end of the first line; and this appears to be the case from the engraving in Fenton's volume, where the inscription is misrepresented entirely in well-formed equal-sized Roman capitals, its reading being however correctly given as follows <p>TVNCCETACEVX <p>SORDAARIHICIA <p>CIT.<p>These letters, of which no attempt at explaining them was given by Mr. Fenton, appear to me to be capable of being read as follows <p>TUNC CETACE UX-<p>SOR DAARI HIC IA <p>CIT. <p>the third word UXSOR being evidently an orthographical error for UXOR.<p>With the exception of the letter T, which occurs in the first and third lines of the inscription, and which, is of an uncial form, it will be observed that all the letters are Roman capitals, tolerably well formed, although irregular in size. We may therefore, I think, safely refer its date to a period but little, if indeed at all, more recent than the departure of the Romans from the Principality. <p>The letters average 3 1/2 inches in height'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 217: `Roman capitals, in good style, with half-uncial T's'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Legibility:</strong><td>some<br>Westwood/1856, and Westwood/1879, appear to have been working from an incomplete rubbing as Nash-Williams/1950, 218, Fig. 251 shows a complete inscription.<p>Macalister/1945, 428-429, states that some of the letters were obscured when it was in the wall, but `the inscription is quite clear'.</em>
