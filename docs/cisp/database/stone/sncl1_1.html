<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>RCAHMW/1925, lii: `St. Nicholas is one of the Pembrokeshire parishes visited by Mr. Edward Lhuyd or one of his assistants about the year 1690, when a rough sketch of the stone and its inscription was made by the visitor. Its substantial accuracy will appear if it is compared with the photograph'.<p>RCAHMW/1925, 379: `Leaning against the chancel wall are two other pillar stones, which formerly served as gateposts on the farm of Llandrudian'.<p>Rhys/1898a, 54, explains how this stone was noticed by Mr. William Williams, a postman, who reported the find to Mr. W. H. Clapp of Fishguard, who in turn reported it to Mr. H. W. Williams of Solva, who told Rhys. The postman had been passing the stone for 25 years, but noticed the text following an article in the <em>Pembroke County Guardian</em>. The stone was then visited by Mr. H. Williams, accompanied by the manager of the local hotel, Mr. W. Dunstan, where they took rubbings etc. and relayed their results to Rhys. At the time, Lhwyd's unpublished drawings were not known to Rhys, Westwood, etc. and the stone was thought to be a `new' find.<p>Macalister/1945, 429: `found acting as gateposts on the farm of Llanrudian...now preserved in the vestry of the parish church'.</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Rhys/1898a, 55--56: `the AA look peculiar, and they seem to join like two deltas. The last consonant is an N with its middle line drawn the wrong way...the last limb of it looks also prolonged, as if to form a pendant to the longish perpendicular of the P. As to this first letter, Mr. Williams calls attention to a point or hollow underneath the semicircle forming the upper part of it, and suggests one might with the aid of this read R. The hollow or depression in question is visible in all three rubbings. It does not seem, however, to join the P, and I am inclined to regard it as no part of the writing; but this is partly because I can make nothing of a name <em>Ranni</em>, while I can make something of <em>Paani</em>. While desirous that this should be treated provisionally as an open question, I proceed to submit what I should have to say of the reading <em>Panni</em>'.<p>Macalister/1945, 429: `[in the missing line] the VA being ligatured. The first line, containing the first two words, is now broken away except the tips of some of the letters: only the third word, which was pocked, remains in good condition'.<p>Macalister also notes that the cross runs into the initial P.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 217: `Roman capitals, deeply cut in rather clumsy style, with horizontal final -I. AA and NI are conjoined'.</em>

Macalister/1945, 429, notes that in Lhwyd's time there was a second line of text which is now missing, see drawing reproduced in RCAHMW/1925, 380. <p>Nash-Williams/1950, 217: `with vestiges of further lettering on the r. edge of the face'.</em>
