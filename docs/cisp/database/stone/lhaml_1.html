J. Howell, Rector of the parish, kindly furnished me with rubbings of the stone in June, 1877, enabling me to complete my figures'. <p>Macalister/1949, 136: `Discovered by Westwood doing duty as a lintel in the ruins of the mediaeval rectory of Llanhamlach. This building...was afterwards demolished, and the stone transferred to the modern rectory, where it was to be seen in 1874. It was afterwards moved to the churchyard, and now stands against the outside of the church porch, on the E. face'.</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong><a href="../manual/node3.html#decorX" target=manual class=man>Decorations:</a></strong><td><p>Westwood/1876, 68--9: `ornamented on the outer edge with an interlacing double ribbon-pattern (fig. 4), whilst on the inner edge is the inscription...The under-side of the stone, as fixed in the top of the window at the time of my visit, exhibited a variety of patterns, chiefly of an interlacing character with a square cruciform design in the middle. Since my visit the stone has been rescued from its former position, and it has been found that the upper part of the design consists of a cross of the Latin form, each limb formed of three incised lines which are dilated at the ends, on either side of which is represented a human figure most rudely delineated, with raised arms and outspread fingers, as in the attitude of prayer, and a long shirt-like garment reaching down to the knees. The figure on the left side of the cross is smaller than the other on the right side, the latter of which has a large circle between the arm of the cross and the head of the figure, two smaller circles over the shoulders, and two upon the breasts of the figure, from each of which last mentioned circlets three small straight lines extend downwards. `At first sight', says Prof. Rhys, `they seem to stand under a cross, but I am not certain that it is not the apple-tree with Adam and Eve beneath it; at any rate, above the lady's shoulders there are two or three small circles which may be an attempt at representing apples' (Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 332). As a small part of the basal portion of this cross was visible whilst in its former situation, and closely resembled the same part of the Llandevailog cross (Pl. XXXIII. fig. 2), I felt satisfied that the whole represented a cross with figures of the Virgin Mary and St. John standing at its sides...I presume, notwithstanding the larger size of the figure on the right-hand side, that the peculiarities of the ornament over the shoulders and on the breasts indicate a female, and it is probable that a larger size was given to this figure in order to express a greater amount of reverence to the mother of the Redeemer than was due to St. John'.<p>Rhys/1905, 71: `On the face appears a Latin cross with figures, supposed by Westwood to represent the Virgin Mary and St. John standing beneath the arms of the cross'.<p>Macalister/1949, 137: `The designs are pocked. On the face of the stone there is a cross with bifid ends to the arms: the part above the cross-arm is lost with the fracture of the stone. Below the cross are two figures, male on the dexter, female on the sinister side. Although they appear at first sight to be attired in tunics this may be merely a result of the barbaric drawing: for the figures are clearly nude, and are most probably meant for Adam and Eve. The whole design, including the interlacements, illustrates an advanced artistic degradation'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 76--77: `The face and edges of the stone bear rudely picked decoration within cable-borders (mostly fractured away); the stone is also inscribed. <em>Front</em>. The upper part of the face is filled with a large combined outline and linear Latin cross with bifid terminals, with incised motifs in the interspaces: (a) top l., wanting; (b) top r., square key-pattern (R.A. 908, used also on Nos. 37-8); (c) bottom l., standing male figure, facing front clad in a long straight tunic, with arms upraised (`<em>orans</em>') and holding a book (?) in the r. hand. In the field on either side are nondescript linear motifs; (d) bottom r., standing female figure, with stylized breasts (?) and arms upraised, facing front, clad in a long straight tunic, with roundels (? brooches) on the shoulders. In the spaces on either side are linear motifs as before. In the field below the cross are miscellaneous motifs disposed in two rows: (a) upper - straight key-pattern (R.A. 908), quadruple-looped square[1] (based on R.A. 810), irregular double-beaded knot; (b) lower - horizontal band of plain four-cord plaitwork (R.A. 503). The combination of central cross and flanking figures is clearly intended to symbolize the Crucifixion (Pl. LXIX, 10), with the male figure representing St. John and the female figure the Blessed Virgin. <em>Left</em>. Part of a vertical band of four-cord double-beaded plaitwork (R.A. 503). <em>Right</em>. Latin inscriptions'.</em>

Basil Jones, at the Meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at Brecon in 1853, objected to my explanation of the word `johannis,' and noticed the difficulty of the double name `Johannis Moridic' occurring at so early a period, suggesting that the original inscription ran thus --  `Pro salute Johannis'. I know nowhere of such a formula having been adopted in Wales. Would it not rather have been, `Orate pro anima johannis'. But (1) the letters are too old for such a formula; (2) the word is clearly a nominative in conjunction with Moridic; (3) the nominative Johannis, from the Greek...was in common use in our early MSS; and (4) the neighbouring Llanfrynach stone shows a similar form of the name'.<p>Rhys/1905, 71--72, following Westwood/1876, sees this inscription and LHAML/1/2 as one, but Macalister/1922, 206, Macalister/1949, 137, and Nash-Williams/1950, 77, all identify two inscriptions.</em>
