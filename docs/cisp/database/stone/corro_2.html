According to him, the cave was surrounded by `the remains of a tumulus of about twenty yards in diameter' at that time...Today, the tumulus no longer exists, the entrance being hidden underneath the path mentioned(cp. photograph 9). If compared with Ferguson's description, the souterrain cannot be entered to the same extent as in his days now because it has filled up with mud (cp. photograph 6). The present stone (numbered 12 by Macalister, <em>CIIC</em>), is still in reach, however.<p></em>
