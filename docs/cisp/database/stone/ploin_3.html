<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 131--32: `In Le Grand's time this granite pillar was described as being inside the chapel of Saint Budoc; Le Pelletier saw it within the parish church of Plourin but it had disappeared by 1837 when Kerdanet published his revised edition of Le Grand's work...Le Pelletier's original manuscript was compiled in 1716 but he was encouraged to revise and abridge it for publication. The revised version, known as the `Lesquiffiou manuscript', formed the basis of his printed dictionary, eventually published posthumously in 1752. However, the corresponding account of the inscriptions in the Lesquiffiou manuscript has been scored out and did not appear in the published version of the dictionary.<p>There are therefore two autograph sketches made by Le Pelletier, one a copy of the other, to compare with the engravings in Le Grand's `Histoire admirable de Sainct Budoc', made more than half a century earlier. Comparison of all three assists in the reconstruction of what was actually to be seen on the lost stone in the 17th and 18th centuries'.</em>

The use of a backward N, with an oblique stroke which goes from bottom left to top right, inverted angle-bar As, the comb-shaped M, as well as the serifs on letters such as I, L, V, A, and F, are indicative of a date range within the late 5th, 6th or early 7th century. The three examples of L with a leftward extension from the top of the ascender are paralleled at Guer (GUER1/1] as well as at Tintagel [TNTIS/1] and other sites in south-west Britain, Wales, and Wareham [WRHAM/3]'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 134--135: `NOMAILI. The second element, <em>-mail</em>, from Celtic nominative <em>maglos</em> (Early Welsh <em>mael</em>, OIr. <em>mál</em>) `prince' is well attested. It is masculine, in the genitive here, although Latin <em>filius</em> is nominative. The older spelling <em>magl(o-)</em> is still found in 6th-century sources, such as Gildas's <em>Maglocune</em> (a Latinized vocative). In the later 6th-century Gallo-Latin spelling of the <em>Decem Libri Historiarum</em> of Gregory of Tours, this element occurs as <em>macl-</em> in the names <em>Macliavus</em> and <em>Uidimaclis</em> (both chieftains from Brittany). However, at more or less the same period comes the record of <em>Mailoc Britionensis ecclesiae episcopus</em> noted at the Council of Braga in 572. <em>Mailoc</em> is a completely medieval, as opposed to an ancient British, form. Where <em>magl(o-)</em> is retained in sources of OB date, this is an archaism: e.g. <em>Maglus Conomagli filius</em> in the 9th-century Life of St Winwaloe, <em>Tigernmaglus</em> in the Life of Paul Aurelian of AD 884, and <em>Briomaglus</em> in the 11th-century Life of St Brieuc, <em>Catmagli</em> in the Cartulary of Landévennec. The usual OB spelling is <em>mael</em> or <em>mail</em>, later also <em>mel</em>, and is very common. As in the present inscription, the loss of <em>-g-</em> can occur together with Latinized case endings and old stem vowels: e.g. <em>tege[r]no-mali</em> from Cornwall [CUBRT/1], older <em>*Tegerno-maglos</em>.<p><em>Nomaili</em>, inspite of a <em>Nemagli</em> from Wales, is exceptionally unlikely as a complete name. Since it is unlikely that father and son bore identical names, it could stand for <em>[Teger]nomaili</em> (see above) or alternatively <em>[Cu]nomaili</em> (cf. OB <em>Cunmailus</em> or <em>[Co]no-maili</em> (cf. <em>Conomagli</em> above, OB <em>Conmael</em>), both from Celtic <em>*Kuno-maglos</em>'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#uenomaili>Uenomaili</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Davies et al/2000, 135: `UENOMAILI, also masculine and genitive, would derive from Celtic <em>*Windo-maglos</em> (`fair' + `prince'), with the same final element as in the son's name. It is OB <em>Uuinmael</em> (CR no. 85), <em>Uuenmael</em> (CR no. 159).<p>With respect to linguistic dating criteria, the coincidence of <em>magl(o-)</em> having already gone to <em>mail-</em> and <em>Uindo-</em> to <em>Uen(o)-</em>, with the retention of ancient stem vowels (e.g. <em>Ueno-</em>), would suit the late 6th or 7th century. Although the forms cited above from the Saints' Lives point to the possible later survival of archaic spellings, it is likely that old manuscript sources had been used in such cases, thereby accounting for the archaisms. There is no evidence that such a tradition persisted for contemporary indi-viduals commemorated in stone after about 700'.</em>
