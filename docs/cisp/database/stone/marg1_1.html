<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Rhys/1873, 8: `Aug 27. --...From this stone we went up Margam mountain, a distance of some three miles or so, to see the stone called Carreg Lythyrenog.  It stands erect on the mountain not far from a little pool called Llyn-dwr-mawr'.<p>Westwood/1876, 22: `The description and figure published in Bishop Gibson's edition of Camden's Britannia, from, as there is reason to believe, the communication of Edward Lhwyd, of an early inscribed stone on the top of the mountain north of Margam Abbey, induced me to hunt for this interesting monument, when I traversed the mountain in different directions for several hours...I might indeed have lost my labour had it not been for the information given me by a passer-by: for the stone itself had been thrown down and no longer presented that striking mark for observation which it must have done when erect.[1]...when I visited it, [it was] lying amongst the stones still remaining of this tumulus.<p>[1] Thanks to the elegant poetical remonstrance on the overthrow of this stone published in the Arch. Camb. 1853, p. 78. the stone has been re-erected'.<p>Macalister/1945, 384--385: `Formerly on the summit of Ton Mawr, a height in Mynydd Margam, at the head of the tributary of Afon Cynfigg; but now carried down to Margam Museum and there deposited.[1]...The stone was removed to its present position because modern persons of the same category [i.e. `ignorant common people'], aggrieved, presumably, by a strong iron railing which had been erected to protect it from sacrilegious hands, had been amusing themselves by firing revolver shots at it'.<p>[1] A cast of the stone has been set up on the original site'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 37: `formerly standing on a low mound (I i 271) on Mynydd Margam at 340m above O.D. when it was known as `Carreg Kythyrogg'.[1]...The stone had been mutilated by modern graffiti and an O.S. bench mark before being moved to Margam Museum, its present location. It has been replaced by a modern replica.<p>[1] Stowe MS. 1024, fos. 10 and 16'.</em>

<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#bodvoci>Bodvoci</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Jaskson/1953, 290--291 discusses the name <em>Bodvoci</em>. Following a Gaulish example of <em>Bodvacus</em> he suggests that <em>Bodvoci</em> may show <em>o</em> for <em>a</em>. However, he also suggests that <em>-vocus</em> and <em>-vacus</em> may actually be two different suffixes. Jackson is also wary of using the spelling <em>Bodvoc</em> found on early British coins as evidence for sound-changes in British.<p>Westwood/1879, 23: `Gibson added the following explanations in support of his reading: `...(vide Reines. Syntagma Inscript. p. 932)...In the work of Reinesius above referred to we find the epitaph of one Boduacus, dug up at Nismes in France, whereupon he tells us that the Roman name Betulius was changed by the Gauls into Bodvacus, but it may seem equally probable, if not more likely, since we also find Bodvoc here, that it was a Gaulish or British name; and the name of the famous queen of the Iceni seems also to have the same original'. It must now be added that, since the days of Camden, coins both of gold and silver, doubtfully supposed to be of British origin, have been found with the name Bodvoc upon them (Ruding's Coinage, British Series, App. pl. 29, and see my notes thereon in Arch. Cambr. 1859, p. 291). The name Bodvognatus is also mentioned by Caesar, De Bell. Gall. iii. 23''.<p>Rhys/1905, 79: `<em>Bodvoci</em> is the gentive of the Brythonic <em>Bodvo~co-s</em>, a name met with abbreviated as BODVO, BODVOC, BODVOS on coins found mostly in Gloucestershire and the West of Oxfordshire...Bodv-o~co-s was the Brythonic form of what was Bodva~co-s, genitive Bodva~ci in Gaulish'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 146: `The name Bodvoc is met with elsewhere on early British coins of the 1st century B.C. found in the Oxfordshire-Gloucestershire region and on Roman Samian vessels as the stamp of a potter Bodvocus, who worked at Lezoux in Gaul in the mid-2nd century A.D.[2]<p>[2] Evans, <em>Coins of the Ancient Britons</em>, p. 134; Oswald, <em>Stamps on Terra Sigillata</em>, p. 45'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#catotigirni>Catotigirni</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Jackson/1953, 279, 446 and 645 discusses this name. At p. 645 he suggests that the spelling of <em>o</em> for <em>u</em> in the composition vowel may reflect a reduction in this vowel, and hence an early sign of syncope, or loss of the composition vowel. Rhys/1905, 79--80: `<em>Catotigirni</em> stands for the genitive of <em>Catutegernio-s</em>, which makes in Welsh <em>Cattegirn</em> and <em>Catëyrn</em> `war-lord or battle-prince''.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#eternali>Eternali</a> (Language: Latin; Gender: male)<br>
Jackson/1953, 192--193, argues that ETERNALI has been carved for a correct <em>Eternalis</em>. Also see p. 291. Westwood/1879, 24: `Aeternalis as a proper name occurs in sepulchral lapidary inscriptions, as may be seen in Smith's Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, vol. i p. 856: Eterni also as a proper name occurs on one of the inscribed stones at Llannor in Carnarvonshire, as well as at Clydai'.<p>Rhys/1905, 79: `<em>Eternali</em> for <em>Aeternalis</em>, derived from <em>Aeternus</em>, which , as <em>Eternus</em>, genitive <em>Eterni</em>, occurs more than once in our inscriptions in Wales'.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#vedomavi>Vedomavi</a> (Language: Brittonic; Gender: male)<br>
Jackson/1953, 440, 444, 482 argues that this name provides evidence of Primitive Welsh <em>*maw</em> from <em>*magu</em>; that it helps to demonstrate that <em>g</em>><em>u</em> had occurred by the later sixth century and that <em>M</em> was actually used for the sound <em>µ</em>. Rhys/1905, 80, regards this name as a place name, not a personal name, with <em>magos</em> meaning `field or plain', and provides a long commentary.<p>Jackson/1953, 440, and 444, treats the name as Brittonic.</em>
<li><a href=../index/name_alpha.html#vedomali>Vedomali</a> (Language: Incomplete Information; Gender: male)<br>
As read by Macalister/1945, 385, but he notes that it could easily be Vedomavi.</em>
