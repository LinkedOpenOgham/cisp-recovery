<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>first mentioned, 1798 Morganwg, I.
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Iolo Morganwg, 1798, reproduced in Allen/1893, 326, 328--330: `I have already observed that the author of the additions to <em>Camden</em> takes notice only of the monumental stone behind the church erected by Samson to the memory of Iltutus [LTWIT/2]. This circumstance proves that the other ancient inscribed stones [including this one] were not then to be seen...In the summer of 1798 I dug out of the ground in Llantwit churchyard a large monumental stone, and its history affords a remarkable instance of the fidelity of popular traditions. About forty years ago a very old man, his name Richard Puntor, was then living at Lanmaes-juxta-Lantwit, who, though only a shoemaker, was a more intelligent man than most of his own class. He had read history more than many, was something of an antiquary, and had stored his memory with a number of interesting popular traditions. I was then about twelve or fourteen years of age; like him, fond of history and antiquities. He one day showed me a spot on the east side of the porch of the old church at Lantwit, where he said a large monumental stone lay buried in the ground, with an inscription on it to the memory of two kings. The tradition of the accident which buried it in the ground he gave as follows...[a similar account of the story is given by Donovan, quoted by Westwood, and is given below].<p>After I had heard this traditional account I had a great desire to dig for this stone, and many times endeavoured to engage the attention of several, and their assistance; but my idea was always treated with ridicule.<p>In the year 1789, being at work in Lantwit Church, and being one day unable to go on with my business for want of assistance, it being the height of the corn-harvest, and not a man to be found, I employed a great part of one evening in digging in search of this stone, and found it.  Evening brought the farmers and workmen home, and Mr. Chrisr. Wilkins and Mr. David Jones, two very respectable gentlemen farmers. On seeing the stone they ordered their men to assist me. We with difficulty got it out of the ground...It lay on the ground where it had been risen out of the grave, till Aug. 28, 1793, when I procured assistance to erect it against the east side of the porch, where it now stands. It must have been buried in the ground before the continuator of Camden took a copy of the inscriptions on Iltutus etc.; otherwise he would certainly have copied this also, as he likewise would have the stone placed by Thomas Morgan, before the church door, had it been there'.<p>Rhys/1873, 9: `Aug. 30. -- The rector kindly accompanied me to Llantwit-Major, where we knew there were several inscriptions'.<p>Westwood/1879, 12--13: `This tall quadrangular shaft in the middle of the last century stood in the churchyard, but in digging a grave near its base it fell into the hole,[1] where it lay till 1793, when it was raised and erected against the east side of the south porch of Llantwit Church, where it now stands.<p>[1] Donovan gives the following details of this accident (Tour in S. Wales, i. 345):-- `Many years ago a tradition prevailed in this part of the country that a large sepulchral stone, which recorded the memory of two kings, had been accidentally buried in the grave of `Will the Giant'. This was a young man, so called on account of his extraordinary stature, being 7 feet 7 inches in height when he died, although he had only then attained his seventeenth year. Will had desired to be interred near this stone, which then stood erect against the wall, but in preparing the grave of sufficient dimensions to admit his remains, the sexton incautiously dug so close to the foot of the stone, that just as the body was laid into the earth it gave way, and falling from the wall into the grave with prodigious violence, it was found impossible, or at least inconvenient at that time to remove it, the stone was therefore left in the position in which it fell, and the grave being filled up, it was completely covered over with earth. This transaction had taken place so long ago that the recollection of it had nearly faded by degrees away. But Mr. Edward Williams, who resides at the village of Flemingstone, only a few miles from the spot remembered having heard the story when a boy, and proposed at some future day to search for the stone. An opportunity at length offered to this intelligent mason to gratify his curiosity, be began by clearing the ground in the spot described to him so many years before, and discovered it at a small depth below the surface, after which he obtained assistance to raise it from the earth and place it against the wall where it now stands'.<p>Allen/1889, 119, `The pillar of Samson, King Juthael, and Artmal, erect against the east wall of the south porch of the old western church outside'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 58: `Shaft of pillar-cross originally standing in the churchyard of St. Illtud's Church just E. of the porch, and having fallen was re-erected near that spot in 1793; in 1900 it was re-set within the W. nave of the church.[1]<p>[1] Arch.

Another son of Iuthail, by name Fernmail, is recorded in <em>Annales Cambriae</em> as having died in the year 775; we may presume that he was already dead at the time of the Llandaf document. This suggests a date late in the eighth century for Abbot Samson, who probably erected his monument after Iuthail and Artmail had also died'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 144: `Manuscript influence is also evident in the dedicatory formula <em>In nomine Dei...incipit crux</em>, which echoes the introductory phrase commonly used in the contemporary manuscript Gospels.[1]<p>[1] Cf. <em>FASIM</em>, p. 7 (Utrecht Gospels---<em>Incip(iunt) in nomine dni ni Ihu Xpi evangelia,</em> &c.). The variation in form of the double letters (MM) in l. 3 is also a manuscript feature. See <em>CLA</em>, [Lowe/1934--72] No. 159; Lindsay, <em>Early Welsh Script</em>,  p. 4'.</em>

Sharon Turner read them teca+ni, the i being inserted within the n. Messrs. Haddan and Stubbs read the last word as tecain---( = decani +), converting the initial t into d and reading the in backwards, and thus turning Arthmael into a dean'.<p>Allen/1889, 121: `The most remarkable letter in the Llantwit inscriptions in the m on the cross of Samson and King Juthael. It consists of three vertical strokes and a transverse bar across the middle, -- a peculiarity occurring in the Irish MSS. of the best period, such as the Lindisfarne and St. Chad's Gospels, and on inscribed stones at Jarrow, co. Durham, at Vaenor, Newborough, and Llangadwaladr, in Anglesey. The full stop, made with three dots...on the pillar of Samson and King Juthael, should be noticed. The same form of stop is used on inscribed stones at St. Vigeans (Forfarshire), Jarrow (Durham), on the cross of Grutne at Margam, in the Psalter (Vesp. A.1) in the British Museum, and in St Chad's Gospels'.<p>Rhys/1899, 147: `Among the peculiarities of the lettering may be mentioned the form of the D, which reminds one of that occurring twice on Crux Crizdi. The first <em>m</em> in summi is made with the bar, which should be at the top of the three perpendiculars, drawn through them, giving the letter the appearance of an H with three perpendiculars, or two H'S made into one.[1] The R is rather more like a capital H than we have been able to have it represented here. The P has the lower end of the curve seldom joined to the perpendicular. The S is always of the tall or gamma kind, and overshadows the <em>u</em> in <em>[Gamma]u</em>, while in [Gamma]ua it branches like the first <em>s</em> on the cross which bears Iltut's name. The <em>et</em> consists in each instance of E with the t indicated by a tag, or imperfect t attached to the horizontal bar of the [cursive-E]. Where I have only given one or two points, there were at first probably three, though it is hard or impossible to detect them now'.<p>Macalister/1928, 313: `Old readings made [the last name] TECAM or TECAIN: I can see TEC, after which there seems to me to be a `G', but I can find nothing more'.<p>Macalister/1949, 156: `The ET which Rhys shews after ARTMALI is worn but traceable: I cannot, however, follow him in reading the last  word TECANI. I cannot see the ANI; the G which I substitute, though it makes a much more awkward reading, is to my eyes, quite clear'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 144: `Round half-uncials...with the early compendium for ET. Some of the letters have forked serifs. The inscription is interpunctuated, in the manner of contemporary manuscripts, with single and multiple points variously grouped'.<p>RCAHMW/1976, 59: `The lettering is crude half-uncials with such common manuscript features as ligatured forms of <em>et</em> and <em>-ex</em>, punctuation dots (single, double or triple), and the use of both majuscule and minuscule forms in a word in which the letter is repeated (M in <em>summi</em>, and S in <em>Samsonis</em>)'.</em>

One of these is directly connected with the other persons mentioned in the Llantwit inscriptions, thus: Arthmael, who must have lived at the beginning of the ninth century, had three sons, Meuric (killed A.D. 843) Rhys, and Ithel (killed A.D. 846).  His grandsons were, Brochmail and Ffernmail, sons of Meuric, and Howel, their first cousin, son of Rhys. All these were contemporaries of Cyfeiliawg, Bishop of Llandaff (consecrated A.D. 872); and Samson must also have lived at the same time, for his name is associated with those of Brochmail and Ffernmail in the grant of Meuric ap Arthmael to Bishop Cerenhire. There is thus a consensus of evidence to show that the Llantwit stones were erected some time between the middle of and the end of the ninth century'.<p>Rhys/1899, 149: `I take <em>Artmali</em> to be a careless spelling for <em>Artmaili</em>: the name occurs as Artmail = Arthmail; in later spelling <em>Arthuail</em> or <em>Arthvail</em>, and <em>Arthuael</em>'.<p>Macalister/1949, 156: `Fernmail, son of Iudhail, died in A.D. 775; his brother Artmail seems to have died somewhat later'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 144: `None of the persons mentioned in the inscription can now be certainly identified'.<p>Also see Jackson/1953, 465, 572.</em>

Rhys/1899, 149: `Lastly, the last name <em>Tecani</em> or <em>Tecain</em> -- I prefer the former -- is partly impossible now to read, as are also some of the other letters, on account of the peculiar lichen growing on the stone. Every one of them could probably be read if the stone were to be put in the church and the lichen forced to die off: there is plenty of room where some other inscribed stones have been placed in the old western church now disused. To return to the last vocable, one may identify <em>Tecani</em> with <em>Teican</em>, the name of a witness with <em>Samson</em> -- both clerics -- to a charter in favour of Llandaff in the time of Bishop Catguaret, and of the king Ris or Rhys, son of Iudhail'.<p>Macalister/1949, 156: `The name of a cleric called Teican appears in the <em>Book of Llandav</em> at about the same date [A.D. 775]'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 144: `None of the persons mentioned in the inscription can now be certainly identified'.</em>
