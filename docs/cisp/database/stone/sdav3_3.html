The interesting memorial, here illustrated, of the interment of two Sons of a Bishop of St. David's of the eleventh century, was recently discovered by Mr. Morgan, the leading mason of the works, during operations connected with the restoration of the two arches of entrance into the Lady Chapel. It had been employed as rubble to raise the wall preparatory to the erection by Bishop Vaughan (1509--23) of the vaulted roof of the cross-aisle or ante-chapel, some 5 ft. 6 in. above the corbels which supported the timbers of the original roof'.<p>Westwood/1892, 78: `INSCRIBED STONE AT ST.  DAVID'S. -- The fortunate discovery made on taking down some of the rubble of the western gable of the Lady Chapel of St.  David's Cathedral, in order to insert a relieving arch above the twin arches of the entrance, now under repair'.<p>Allen/1896, 292, `Found, in 1892, built into the rubble wall at the west end of Lady Chapel of Cathedral, now fixed in wall of south transept'.<p>Macalister/1949, 173, `Built into the East wall of the South Transept of St. David's Cathedral...discovered in 1891'.</em>

Its original length probably exceeded 3 ft.; the present length is 2 ft. 7 in.<p>The sculpture is very well executed, the material having probably been softer when fresh from the quarry than at present.

Wall., pl.  60), the curious step-pattern in figures 1 and 3, whilst the pretty central device of the four interlaced hearts is exactly copied in figure 3 of the same plate'.<p>NB: Westwood/1892 is the only publication to provide a drawing of the cross on the back of this monument.<p>Macalister/1949, 174: `The stone bears a cross in a circle, ormamented with interlacement, which can be best understood by referring to the drawing. Above it is a small plain cross'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 210--211: `The stone bears carved decoration back and front, and is also inscribed. <em>Front</em>. This face is decorated with an ornamental wheel-cross carved in medium relief, framed in a plain-bordered circular panel with a small Latin cross above and part of the upper quadrants of a second wheel-cross (?) conjoined below (cf. No. 357). To the l. of the Latin cross is a Latin inscription (Fig. 238) in an irregular incised outline panel (see below). The arms of the Latin cross are faintly splayed and edged with an incised line. In the interspaces above and below are the Greek letters...The wheel-cross below is of debased Anglo-Norse form, with slightly splayed arms, wide angular interspaces, and fully extended wheel.[6] The arms are filled with four-cord double-beaded interlacing carved in medium relief, comprising double Stafford-knots with bifurcations, interjoined around a central composite knot of Celtic type and merging at the arm-ends into double-beaded straight fret filling the arcs of the wheel. The bifurcated plait and the straight fret are both usually regarded as Scandinavian features.[1] The second wheel-cross was perhaps of similar form, but undecorated save for a double-beading to the arms (? and wheel) and with pellets or bosses in the interspaces...<em>Back</em>. This face bears a plain Latin cross, of the same form as that in front, carved in relief, suggesting that the stone was intended to stand erect.<p>[6] Cf. <em>NC</em>, [Collingwood/1927] p. 14 and fig. 154 (showing somewhat similar decoration of the cross-arms); <em>MC</em>, [Kermode/1907] pl. xlvii  (showing Scandinavian features).<p>[1] For the bifurcated plait see AADS, i, p. 288; iii, p. 264. For the fret, ibid., p. 160'.</em>

The occurrence of the formula on the present stone suggests that Romanesque influence was reaching St. Davids already immediately before the arrival of the Normans.<p>[2] Cf. ICG, ii, [LeBlant/1865] p. viii'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Westwood/1892, 79: `With the exception of the monogram of the name of the Deity, the letters of this inscription are all minuscules, very irregular in size, and carelessly formed, the a's having the second stroke nearly straight, with the bottom slightly curved upwards, and the main stroke large and swollen; the b very oblated; the c of the simple form; the d circular, with the second stroke formed into curve turned over to the left; the f with the top stroke deflected to right, and nearly meeting the second transverse stroke; the h, i, l, m, n, o, p, q, s, t, and u of the ordinary minuscule forms; and the r like a capital R, with the first straight stroke extending considerably below the line, and the lower portion of the second stroke extended in a straight line directed to the right. The t in the top line is peculiar, being evidently intended for a minuscule t of the usual form, the lower part forming an imperfect circle. The first letter above the arms of the cross is a capital A, with a nearly straight line resting on the top of the letter, and the middle crossbar strongly angulated, as in early MSS. The Omega is quite unusual, its form being of the w type, but nearly square, with the middle stroke extended upwards, with a short transverse terminal stroke, above which is a longer curved line indicating the contraction of the name...It will be moreover noticed that the not unusual form of the conjunction `et' in the shape of the figure 7, often found in Anglo-Saxon MSS., occurs both in this new inscription and also in the `Gurmarc' stone from Pen Arthur, now in St. David's Cathedral (Lap.  Wall., pl. 60, fig.  2), corrected by the discovery of the top left-hand corner of the stone as represented in Arch. Cambrensis, July 1889- (5th Series, No.  23, p. 252), which shows the Alpha and Omega, the former of rare occurrence, as in the newly-found stone, followed by `7' and w, and the ibs and xps'.<p>Rhys/1905, 42: `Hiberno-Saxon letters'.<p>Macalister/1949, 174: `The first son's name has been read HED, but it looks more like NED (perhaps = <em>Nudd</em>); the initial differs in appearance from the H at the beginning of the preceding word'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 211: `Irish round half-uncials. The words are interpunctuated with single points set above the line. 7, the old Tironian sign for ET, is found in Irish writing and inscriptions from the 8th century onwards'.</em>
