<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>first mentioned, 1630 Gordon, R.
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Forsyth/1996, 299: `This large, ogham-inscribed cross-slab was transferred to Dunrobin Castle Museum in 1868 (Acc. No. 15/15A) from the parish churchyard of nearby Golspie in the county of Sutherland. The cross was certainly in Golspie churchyard in 1856 when it was visited by Stuart, and may have been there as early as 1780. Close-Brooks suggests that Sir Robert Gordon's description of `as ton curiously carved' standing in `Golspie Kirktoun' in 1630 may be the earliest reference.' Forsyth goes on to discuss the uncertain provenance of the stone before this date.</em>
