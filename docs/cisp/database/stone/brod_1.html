<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>non-arch dig, 1781 inc
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Forsyth/1996, 139--140: `This sculptured cross-slab, also known as `Rodney's Stone', was unearthed in 1781 during excavations for the foundations of a new parish church at Dyke ... The new building was constructed behind its pre-Reformation predecessor and the stone evidently came from the graveyard of the old church. It was re-erected in Dyke village the following year in commemoration of Admiral Rodney's victory over the Count de Grasse at the Battle of the Saints, hence it's name. ... Some years before 1842 Rodney's Stone was moved to the grounds of Brodie Castle which is now the property of the National Trust of Scotland. The stone still stands there beneath a wooden shelter at the side of the castle drive [at the time of writing plans are afoot to move the stone indoors at Brodie Castle, not before time].'</em>

The cross is ornamented with a continuous piece of interlace-work composed of different knots thus: -- In the centre of the head of the cross, and vertically above and below it, circular knot No. 433 forming a single row of three knots; on the top arm of the cross and on the upper part of the shaft, the same circular knot arranged in two vertical rows and repeated twice in each row (No. 714); in the narrow parts of the horizontal arms, on each side of the knot in the centre of the head, the same knot but without circular band round it; on the left arm of the cross, Stafford knots, with extra bands interwoven, placed facing in opposite directions (No. 613), the pattern being a good deal obliterated; on the right arm of the cross, interlaced work composed of knots Nos. 265 and 431, the pattern being much defaced; on the bottom of the shaft of the cross, double Stafford knots, with extra bands interwoven, arranged in two vertical rows and repeated twice, the knots above and below being irregular [no. 613]. The background of the cross is arranged in four panels: (1) On the left of the top arm of the cross, a beast with tail and legs forming interlaced-work, partially defaced; (2) on the right of the top arm of the cross, completely defaced; (3) on the left of the shaft of the cross, pairs of beasts interlaced, much obliterated, and with the initials K.D. cut in a recess in the middle; (4) on the right of the shaft of the cross, pairs of beasts interlaced, obliterated near the top, and with the initials A.C. cut in a recess in the middle. ...<p><em>Back</em>. -- A single panel containing at the top a pair of fish monsters, with tails forming spirals, placed facing each other, and with some curious circular objects or ornaments between them; below this the elephant symbol; and at the bottom the double disc and Z-shaped rod symbol. The monsters have jaws with rows of teeth, and are ornamented with triquetras and spirals on the upper part of the body, and with conventionalised scales on the lower part. The body of the elephant is ornamented with interlaced-work composed partly of spiral knots, partly of knot No. 251, and terminating next the head in a Stafford knot. The discs are each ornamented with eight double spirals with C-shaped connections (No. 1108) and small pellets in the spaces between them. The connecting bar between the discs has on it a small piece of interlaced-work composed of two Stafford knots. The angles of the Z-shaped rod are filled in with ornamental pellets.'<p>Forsyth/1996, 142-144: `The whole front face of the cross is taken up with a cross with small rounded hollows at its armpits...The whole of the cross is outlined in a thick roll-moulding, which is also found up the left hand edge...The cross is decorated with accomplished, complex, and delicate interlacing, unfortunately obliterated in places due to lamination. The pattern consists of a single continous band arranged in a series of knots...The back is dominated by a huge pair of sea-monsters which occupy the full width of the slab and almost half its length. Below that are two massive symbols, a Pictish `beast' and a double-disc-and-Z-rod'. All are highly decorated in relief'.</em>

All three sections are carved in the same hand, a neatly consistent Type IIb form of the script. In a couple of places the distal tips of strokes have been lost where the outer edge of the ogham band has flaked off, but even at their full extent the strokes are no more than medium length...There are occasional angled-vowels, and one case of what appears to be a vowel comprising a mix of straight and angled vowel strokes...In the more legible sections component strokes are strictly parallel and evenly-spaced, and individual letters are, in general, carefully spaced, especially when two letters from the same <em>aicme</em> are side-by-side. In  most cases, b- and h-<em>aicme</em> strokes slope in the anticipated direction, the only exceptions are dubious through wear...This is a substantial ogham, neatly and formally carved, as befits a major public monument'.</em>
