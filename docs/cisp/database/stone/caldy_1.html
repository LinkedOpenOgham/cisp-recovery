<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>The stone was visited by Rhys on Aug. 20 1873 where he read the inscription, noted the ogham, and also commented that one corner of the stone was already loose (Rhys/1873, 7).<p>Westwood/1879, 106: `the discovery of an inscribed slab of stone, dug up in the ruins of the priory, subsequently used as a window-sill, and which, in 1810, was found in Mr. Kynaston's garden (Fenton's Pembrokeshire, p. 458), for an excellent rubbing of which I am indebted to Mr. Mason of Tenby. And it is here proper to remark upon the value of these rubbings, since Mr. Mason informs us that during the short period which has elapsed since the rubbing was made the stone itself has been rendered much less legible than it then was, from exposure to weather since its removal to its present position, having been built into the wall of the chapel on the suggestion of the Rev. Mr. Graves' (Repeated from Westwood/1855b).<p>Macalister/1945, 405: `[the stone was ]dug up in the priory grounds some time before 1811...Used for a time as a window-lintel; then as a garden seat; and finally clamped against the inside face of the restored priory chapel, where it is now, at the E. end of the N. side of the nave'.</em>

The extremities of the two limbs of the cross, which remain perfect, are dilated and somewhat furcate.

A Latin cross similar to that in front, but smaller (Fig. 6, 1), is incised on each of the other faces'.</em>

But it might have been in use earlier'.'</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Latin (rbook)
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Rhys/1873, 7, suggests that the `et' with which the Latin inscription begins implies that it was a continuation of the Ogham inscription.<p>Westwood/1879, 107: `Notwithstanding the conjunction `Et' at the commencement of the inscription, which might be supposed to indicate it to be the continuation of a paragraph commenced on the other side of the stone, I am inclined to think, from the evident faults both grammatical and orthographical in the inscription, that we have before us the whole, and that the meaning of the introductory formula is an entreaty, to all passers-by, in the name both (et) of the Cross itself and of Him who was fixed thereon, to pray for the soul of Catuoconus. The word `fingsi' (finxi), it is true, might be supposed to allude to a figure of the Saviour sculptured on the cross, as in one or two rare instances in other parts of Wales, as at Llangan, but this stone bears the plain cross, and cannot therefore be supposed to have been surmounted by a sculptured crucifix. We have before us also a very early instance of the supplication of prayers for the soul of the deceased, and the word employed for that purpose, `exorent,' is a very unusual one in these Welsh inscriptions. This branch of the subject offers interesting material for enquiry in connexion with the question of the age of the inscription itself' (Repeated from Westwood/1855b).<p>Macalister/1945, 406--409: `But the sense of the inscription, owing to its illiterate Latinity, is not easy to grasp, and calls for more detailed discussion than the rest...The latter part, from <em>rogo</em> onward, is fairly easy, the only difficulty being the sense ascribed to <em>ibi</em>. Is it a mistake for <em>hic</em>, `here'? Or does it mean what it says, `there'? Remembering that the stone came from an island, within sight of the mainland, we can understand how to the dwellers on the island, `there' would become a natural expression for `the mainland'...one who wished for prayers might well express the hope that all those who came on pilgrimage to the island, and who returning `walked over there' (as he expressed it in bad Latin), should not forget him: and, moreover, that they should carry out the duty <em>fervently</em>, which presumably is what he meant by <em>ex-orent</em>.<p>As to <em>singno crucis in illam fingsi</em>, we must understand <em>illam</em> as referring to the stone, and may explain its femininity by remembering that in Welsh, the language in which the writer was doubtless thinking, <em>llech</em> is feminine. <em>Singno</em>, in which the attraction of the legitmate <em>n</em> has nasalized the preceding <em>g</em>, may be interpreted in one of three ways: `By the sign of the cross which I have fashioned, I pray' -- a formula of adjuration; as an ablative: `With the sign of the cross I have decorated it'; or as a mistake for the accusative: `I  have fashioned the sign of the cross upon it'. The last is preferable as the simplest of the three possibilities: and the standard of Latinity which it assumes is not too low for our author.<p>What then, of <em>et</em>? It implies that something has gone before L but it certainly does not link on to the Ogham, with which it has nothing whatever to do. Rather does it appear to link to the <em>destruction</em> of the Ogham. We may picture the writer as a hermit on the island, occupying an anchorite cell which preceded the twelfth-century priory. He discovered, and so far as he could, destroyed the heathenish monument, left behind by some Goidel to pollute the sacred island. Before doing so he `disharmed' the paganism of the Ogham by surrounding it with crosses on all sides, as his fellow-anchorites did on Inchgoill... If the space on the stone had permitted, and if his Latinity had been equal to the strain, what he would have said would have been something like this: `[See, I have purged this stone of heathenism], and have fashioned the sign of the cross upon it. I pray to all who return to the mainland to make fervent prayer for the soul of me, Catuoconus'. By this interpretation, the inscription is not the memorial of a dead Catuoconus, but of a Catuoconus no doubt well meaning, but from the standpoint of an epigraphist rather too much alive.<p>In a previous publication I suggested that the inscription made a triad of three metrical lines rhyming in -i...I was inclined afterwards to doubt whether the writer's scholarship was equal to such a <em>tour-de-force</em>, but Prof. I. Williams has assured me that he feels no such uncertainty'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 182: `Animae (Ablative), if not accidental, shows the substitution of <em>ae</em> for <em>a</em> occasionally met with in early inscriptions. The form <em>singno</em> (for <em>signo</em>) probably follows contemporary pronunciation...The formula used in the epitaph is akin in type to that employed on No. 125'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 107--108: `Although offering a certain amount of regularity to the eye, the letters themselves of the inscription are for the most part rudely formed, and about 2 1/2 inches in height, with very little space left between the lines.<p>With the exception of the simply-formed I, C, R (in the first line only), O and F, which are Roman capitals (and even of these, the lower oblique right-hand stroke of the R not carried down to the line, and the upper cross-stroke of the F forming an angle at its origin with the top of the upright stroke, indicate an approach to the minuscule forms of these two letters), the whole of the inscription is in that curious mixture of minuscule and uncial letters transformed into capitals which became general soon after the departure of the Romans, and which is found in all the oldest inscriptions and manuscripts both in Great Britain and Ireland. The conjoined et (&) in the first line and cx in the sixth line are especially interesting from their agreement with such ancient documents; the a like two C's conjoined together, the b slightly variable in form and sometimes scarcely distinguishable from the g, the best formed one being in the fourth line; the e like a c, with a central cross bar free at its extremity; the F almost F-shaped, and not carried below the line; the g especially remarkable, particularly in the first line, where it is reduced in size from the proximity of the foot of the cross; the l formed like a L, with the angle rounded off and the top of the first stroke inclined to the left, although in the fifth line it almost looks like a c; the m invariably m-shaped; the n either like a capital N but with the oblique stroke reversed, or like a H; the p P-shaped, and not carried below the line; the R either R-shaped or like a cursive n, with the second stroke carried down obliquely nearly to the bottom of the line; the s f-shaped, but not carried above the line; the t like a c with a tranverse bar at the top, and the u invariably u-shaped. All these peculiarities indicate the occurrence of a period between the departure of the Romans and the time when this stone was sculptured. But I think, from a comparison of this inscription with other early monuments, both lapidary and manuscript, in England, Wales, and Ireland, that we cannot err in affixing to it the date given above. (J. 0. Westwood, Arch. Camb., 1855, p. 258)'.<p>Macalister/1945, 406: `The letters are half-uncial on the whole, but the N's are H-shaped capitals. Most previous decipherers have overlooked the monogram AE at the end of line 7; otherwise all but one, misled by a squeeze, are agreed on the transcription'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 182: `Round half-uncials (mainly) and capitals (C, F, N, O, P, R), carefully cut in good style. The angular form of the G's is distinctive'.</em>
