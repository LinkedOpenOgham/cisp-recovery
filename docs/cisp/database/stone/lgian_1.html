<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Latin (rcaps)
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Jones/Westwood/1848, 107: `The formula of the inscription, the introduction of the word MEDICI, and the omission of the word HIC, are to be noticed'.<p>Macalister/1945, 366: `The word HIC is absent'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 90: `The mention of the deceased's secular profession is exceptional. Such details, normal in pagan Roman epitaphs, were generally, but not invariably, omitted by the early Christians in conformity with their professed detachment from worldly affairs. This appears to be the only record of a <em>medicus</em> on an Early Christian inscription in Britain. Such mentions are not uncommon in contemporary continental inscriptions'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Jones/Westwood/1848, 106, (in letter from Jones): `I particularly noticed the similarity of the form of the E to that of the same letter in the Llannor inscriptions...and also in the inscription at Llanfihangel y Traethau. The first two letters in the word are almost obliterated, and the word HIC is omitted'.<p>Jones/Westwood/1848, 106--107, (in letter from Westwood): `The letters are entirely Roman capitals which is a positive proof of the great age of the stone. There are, in fact, none of the rude minuscule letters, subsequently in use, intermingled with the capitals...The letter [sic] in this Llangian stone are about two inches high. The M is to be noticed as having its first and last strokes slanting like a W turned upside down (M); and in the second M the tops of these two strokes are carried higher than the places of junction of the strokes of the middle V, giving the letter somewhat of the appearence of the <em>rustic-shaped</em> capital M, which is also an indication of very great age in Roman inscriptions, occuring very often in those found at Pompeii. The L and I in the first word are conjoined, the I not being so tall as the L, and extending below the line; this conjunction indicates a debased style, and which I have seen carried so far that the L and I were formed thus [L I ligature drawn] (The <em>i</em> at the end of the words is often carried like a <em>j</em>, below the line, in early Irish and Anglo-Saxon MSS). The F and R are also debased in their forms, especially the latter, in which the first stroke extends slightly below the line, the loop is very large, and the bottom right hand stroke almost horizontal. We have here, therefore, an approach to the debased minuscule R [drawn] as it appears for instance on some of the Llantwit stones...The M and A, too, in the beginning of the word MARTINI are conjoined. With these exceptions the letters are very good Roman capitals, and I should be inclined to consider the inscription as not later than the fifth century'.<p>Simpson/1863, 130: `For -- as the accompanying woodcut of the Llangian inscription shows -- the F in the word FILI is very much of the same type or form as the F seen by Lhwyd in the Cat-stane, and drawn by him...The context and position of this letter F in the Llangian legend leaves no doubt as to its true character. The form is old and Mr Westwood considers the age of the Llangian inscription as `not later than the fifth century''.<p>Westwood/1879, 179: `The letters of the inscription are entirely Roman capitals...about 2 inches high'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 90: `Roman capitals. LI in l. 1 is conjoined in the Roman cursive fashion'.<p>RCAHMW/1964, 64: `the L and I of the first word are conjoined, also the M and A of the fourth'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Legibility:</strong><td>good<br>Jones/Westwood/1848, 106: `Owing to the weathering of the surface, and the slight depth of the incisions, there was some difficulty at first in reading the inscription, but by means of rubbings this difficulty was removed'.<p>Macalister/1945, 364: `in good condition though worn'.</em>
