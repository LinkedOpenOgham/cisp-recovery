<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 221--22 `This striking stone ... was noted by the Abbé Mahé and Cayot-Delandre [CayotDelandre/1847: 509--10] recorded that it had been knocked over and re-erected during the French Revolution and that subsequently, since it stood in the path of the (new) road, it was shifted to the edge of the road. Keranflec'h first published a description of the stone in 1857, noting the careful workmanship, supplying a reading of the second line shortly after and an improvement on this reading the following year [Keranflec'h/1857: 105, Kernaflec'h/1858: 337]. Subsequent 19th-century discussion focussed on whether or not the commemorand was the wife of Pascwethen, Breton count then ruler in the 870s, and whether or not the stone marked her place of burial. The monument was discussed (with associated photograph) by Bernier, who also stated that it marked the limit of the priory of St Gutual (Goal) on the island and observed that it was known (as was another local stone) as <em>men er menah</em>, the monk's stone.<p>The site was visited by members of the CISP team in May 1997 and June 1999'.</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Language:</strong><td>Latin (rbook)
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 225--26: `CROUX. Use of the word <em>crux</em> is notably paralleled on Insular and Breton inscriptions of 9th- to 11th-century date. ... The apparent hesitation between the standard Latin <em>crux</em> and the Vulgar or Brittonicized <em>crox</em> may be significant. Latin <em>Saxo:</em> 'Saxon, Englishman', gives OB <em>Saus</em>, Modern <em>Saoz</em>. Therefore, <em>croux</em> could reflect a pronunication<em> /krows/</em>, with the same treatment of Latin x'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 225: `The inscription is in half-uncial. The initial C is plain and rounded with the lower arm conjoined to the following half-uncial R. This R has an elongated ascender that continues upward beyond the rightward stroke, and which also tapers downward to a point. The almost straight rightward stroke is conjoined to the following O. The U has a flattish bottom and two slight extensions to the left from the top of the ascenders. The final X of the first line is particularly `wayward' with the top right arm horizontal. The R of the second line is again half-uncial, this time with a curved rather than a straight rightward stroke. The T, S, and N are also half-uncial, with the S vertical and the N H-shaped. The L is curved rather than angular and the two Os are each smaller than the other letters.<p>The lettering on the stone is not sufficiently distinctive to provide a diagnostic date: the use of half-uncial simply suggests that the inscription was carved within the period of the 7th to 10th centuries'.</em>

Davies et al/2000, 226: `PROSTLON. The name is not common, but is attested in OB in precisely this spelling (CR no. 260), where it is the name of a woman. Welsh <em>proestlawn</em> occurs as an honorific epithet for men in early poetry (GPC sn.); its meaning is uncertain, and it is doubtful whether it should be linked to the Welsh metrical term <em>proest</em> (a type of rhyme in which consonants match, but vowels do not). The first elements of <em>proestlawn</em> and <em>Prostlon</em> are probably different, as Welsh <em>oe</em> does not usually correspond to any sound written <em>o</em> in OB. <em>Prost-</em> is probably the equivalent of the well attested early Welsh woman's name <em>Praust</em>. Welsh <em>Eur-braust</em> and <em>Ri-braust</em> contain the same element, and are also women's names which occur in the Late OW text `De Situ Brecheniauc' and in `Cognatio Brychan'. In the same source and list, <em>Proist-ri</em> also occurs, another woman's name, suggesting some confusion or interchange between <em>proest</em> and <em>prawst</em> (= OB <em>Prost-</em>). On the other hand, the equivalence of Welsh <em>-lawn</em> to OB <em>-lon</em> (both 'full') is regular.<p>As to date, Old Celtic unstressed syllables have fallen, a development reflected in spelling from c. 550 onwards. From 900 onwards, the spelling <em>*Prostlun</em> would be possible and would have become common by c. 1000, although, even then, still side-by-side with <em>Prostlon</em>. The absence of a Latinizing genitive ending (i.e. <em>*Prostlone</em>) favours a date later than 600'.<p>Davies et al/2000, 228--229: `The name `Prostlon' on this stone has long been thought to refer to Prostlon, the wife of Pascwethen, a man who was extremely active as count in eastern Brittany in the 860s and was subsequently joint ruler for a short period following the death of the <em>princeps</em> Salomon in 874 (e.g. CR nos. 240, 242, 243, 247, 256, 261). Prostlon was buried at the monastery of Redon, sometime before 876 (CR no. 260). While it is indeed possible that it is this Prostlon who is commemorated on the Pen Pont stone (the name does not appear to have been common in the 9th century, for there are no other occurrences in the 6,000 citations of the Redon cartulary), there is no way of verifying the suggestion ... however by demonstrating that the island of Locoal housed a religious foundation with substantial appurtenant lands by the early 11th century, the charter [CR no. 373] certainly increases the likelihood that there had been notable patronage of a religious foundation on the island by rulers in the 9th or 19th centuries and therefore increases the likelihood that it is indeed the 9th-century Prostlon who is commemorated on the stone'.</em>
