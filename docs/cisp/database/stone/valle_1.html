<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 307: `This stone was discovered in 1933 'lying near the hedge by the pathway leading from the entrance steps to the West door of the church', and published and illustrated in the following year with comments on dating and Insular parallels by Sir Charles Peers [Carey/1934. 132--133). The stone was next cited 25 years later when it was dated to the 7th century and seen as vital evidence for Guernsey's conversion to Christianity. ... It now stands on the southern side of the church's western door, between a small wall and the path leading from the west door to the road. <p>The site and stone were visited by members of the CISP team in August 1999.'</em>

<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Davies et al/2000, 311--12: `The inscription is in capitals. The first line consists of an omega (minuscule form), repeated on the next line, and a second character resembling a backwards C joined to a horizontal I. No exact parallel for this can be found, although a similar symbol, of no lexical import, is found on an inscription from Trier, whilst a not too dissimilar mark is known from a lead coffin in Wales [Nash-Williams/1950, no. 27]. The second line has an alpha and omega on either side of the upright of the cross. The alpha is in the form of a square A where the two uprights do not meet but rather join a flat top stroke; this stroke seems only to extend to the left. The third line has a round capital D and majuscule S, between which is a superlineate contraction mark. This lay-out is reminiscent of the 9th- and 10th-century alpha and omega series from Pembrokeshire [Nash-Williams/1950, nos. 376, 380, 392, 393]. The other letters of the inscription are capitals. The N, S, I, and D are standard capitals, while the lower of the two cross-strokes of the F has been placed very low down on the ascender. The final A is much the same as the alpha of line two, although the top-stroke extends to both right and left, and the letter is shorter and more squat as a result of the uprights being placed farther apart. Being in plain, undecorated capitals the lettering is difficult to date, with only the form of the A at all distinctive; within this corpus the closest parallel, albeit with an angle-bar, is from Lanrivoaré [LRVOA/1], dated to the 7th or 8th century. This form of A, with a flat top stroke, which extends only to the left, is also known from 9th-century manuscripts in Brittany.'</em>

Davies et al/2000, 312: `The name at the end of the inscription is a Germanic compound, represented as a first-declension Latin feminine in the nominative. The second element, which is more or less complete in the inscription, is very common. Both masculine and feminine forms are well attested: e.g., continental examples such as masculine simplex <em>Lantfridus</em>, <em>Sigefridus</em>, <em>Bilefridus</em>; feminine <em>Bricciofrida</em>, <em>Bertefrida</em>, <em>Gundefrida</em>, <em>Immafrita</em>. Frankish masculine names in <em>-fred</em>, <em>-frid</em>, <em>-frit</em>, <em>-fredo</em> or Latinized <em>-fredus</em>, <em>-fredi</em> are also common in CR. Comparable forms from Britain include <em>Fridus</em> [Okasha/1993, no. 62], and <em>Canfridus</em>, <em>Gosfridus</em>, <em>Osfrith</em>, <em>Wealdfrith</em>, and the feminine <em>Osfrida</em>. Forms with <em>-nsfrid-</em> or <em>-nsfrið</em>, as apparently occurs here, are not common. So it remains unclear what the first element might be. However, three individuals named Old English <em>Ansfrith</em> are listed by Searle.</em>
