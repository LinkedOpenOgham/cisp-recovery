The one exception is the half-uncial G (missing in the 84r DEVORICI version, of course), for which the best parallels noted by Nash-Williams (1950: 224) from his Group I of inscriptions (fifth to seventh century) are in three inscriptions which he dated sixth-century (no. 305), late-sixth-century (no. 316), and late-sixth to early-seventh-centuries (no. 54). Jackson dated to the first of these .. To the early seventh century and Charles Thomas gives sixth century, while also quoting Jackson's date ... Epigraphically, then, a sixth- to seventh-century date for the Capel Eithin stone is attractive, although it should be noted that doubts have been raised about Nash-Williams's and Kenneth Jackson's epigraphical dating of Class I stones. ... Of course, comparable half uncial Gs also occur in Nash-Williams's Group II (seventh to ninth centuries): the best parallels occur on his nos. 46 (ninth century) and 124 (seventh to ninth centuries). Yet as a whole, the epigraphy of Capel Eithin is that of Group I rather than Group II'.</em>

Sims-Williams in White/Smith/1999, 147--148: `The name on the stone is not otherwise attested in Britain. DERVORI, on a now lost stone from Llannor parish, Llyn (Nash-Williams, no. 94 = Macalister no. 388), happens to be transcribed immediately after DEVORIGI on fol. 88r of Stowe 1023, but is linguistically distinct. .. The first element of DEVORIGI (genitive of <em>*Devorix</em>) is Celtic <em>*deiwos</em> `god' (cf. Jackson/1953, 375), as in the Old Welsh name <em>Duinerth</em> `divine strength' (Evans/Rhys/1893, 396), so that the whole name might be translated `divine king'. It is a personal name and should certainly not be regarded as a title, nor as an indication of paganism .. In later Welsh the name would be <em>*Dwywyr</em> or <em>*Dwywri</em>, depending on whether the nominative or an oblique case survived .. The long close E of the first syllable may already have become /ui/ in speech in the sixth century, but there is no evidence that the dipthong was shown in writing until the eighth century (Sims-Williams/1991: 49 and 59), so the E spelling proves little.<p>The preservation of the composition vowel -O- with the correct quality is typical of inscriptions which Jackson dated to the fifth and sixth centuries but the possibility of such a conservative spelling in the seventh century cannot be ruled out entirely. The form -RIGI instead on the original British genitive *<em>rigos</em> is paralleled in inscriptions which Jackson dated to the fifth and sixth centuries and it seems likely that our inscription is contemporary with these. Admittedly, final -g was sometimes written in the Old Welsh period (Jackson/1953: 456 cites <em>dou rig</em> in the <em>Historia Brittonum</em>), yet the possibility that DEVORIGI is an artificial Latinized genitive in <em>-i</em> of a form such as Archaic Old Welsh <em>*Deurig</em>, Old Welsh <em>*Duiuri(g)</em>, complete with correctly restored composition vowel, seems remote'.</em>
