<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Discovery:</strong><td>first mentioned, 1698 Lhuyd, E.
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>History:</strong><td>Westwood/1860, 223, 226: `During the last meeting of this Association, held at Cardigan, in August 1859, I took the opportunity of visiting and inspecting three very interesting early inscribed stones in the parish of Clydai, a few miles south of Newcastle Emlyn, to which my attention had been kindly directed by Mr. Vincent and by Dr. Jones, whose charming residence in the valley of the Cych afforded me a pleasant resting-place during my day's ramble in search of these hitherto undescribed relics of antiquity...The third of these Clydai stones is now built into the foot of the steps leading to the granary at Tygoed farm, about a mile north of the church, having been taken from Clydai churchyard'.<p>Rhys/1873, 5: `August 14...About a mile from the church, at a farm-house called Dygoed (more correctly, perhaps, Dugeod), there is a cross-inscribed stone, which also seems bilingual...It would be satisfactory to learn that the old stone is removed to some place, where it would be out of the reach of accidents'.<p>Westwood/1879, 124: `This stone is preserved at the farm of Dugoed[1], one mile to the north of Clydai church, from the churchyard of which it was taken, and to which it ought to be restored. It is now built into the footsteps leading to the granary in the farmyard, where I found it during the Cardigan Meeting of the Archaeol. Cambrian Association, and published the first account of the stone in the Arch. Camb., 1860, p. 227.<p>[1] This is written Tygoed in my article in Arch. Camb., 1860, p. 227'.<p>Allen/1896, 291: `Removed from Clydey and for a long time built into the steps leading to the granary of Dugeod Farm, one mile and a half north of Clydey; now placed inside Clydey Church'.<p>Macalister/1922a, 29: `At CLYDAI I found the stone long preserved at Dugeod farm now housed safely in the Church'.<p>RCAHMW/1925, 75: `The third stone now in Clydai church is said to have once stood in `an old chappel in the churchyard', but at a date not far beyond living memory it was removed to the farm of Dugeod, about two miles north of the church, where it lay until restored to the church by the late Mr. Henry Owen, D.C.L., a member of this Commission...The stone came into notice through enquiries made by Edward Lhuyd, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, of the clergy and others of the Principality in the year 1698. Lhuyd may himself have visited Clydai; but at any rate one of his assistants who reached the place took a sketch of the inscription, and this sketch, or a copy of it, passed at Lhuyd's death in 1709 to Mr. John Anstis, in whose collection, now at the British Museum, it has been preserved. The sketch is extremely rude, and is evidently the work of one who had been told to be a faithful copyist of the letters and markings that he saw upon the stone, but who was not equal to a drawing of the cross...At the moment of going to press another sketch of the third Clydai stone has been discovered amongst the Anstis collection of Lhuyd drawings. This probably represents a second effort, and shows the cross upon the stone...A note to this second drawing names the `old chapel in the churchyard' where the stone was then <em>in situ</em>'.<p>Macalister/1945, 411: `This  stone was at some time conveyed from the churchyard to a farm called Dugoed, about a couple of miles away, where it was seen by the earlier writers who dealt with it. It has, however, now been restored to its proper home, and stands along with the other two'.<p>CISP: the stone remains inside the church.</em>

Two deeply-incised longitudinal lines extend two-thirds down the face of the stone, where they meet a transverse line, apparently forming the stem and base of the cross, although the stem does not arise from the centre of the lower limb of the cross. There are some other shorter horizontal and perpendicular lines (exclusive of the Ogham marks on the left edge of the stone), which appear to be destitute of any meaning'.<p>RCAHMW/1925, 75, 77: `an equal-armed cross within a circle. The form of the cross is similar though not identical with many of the earliest cross that are found in the Celtic areas of the British Isles...It may be added that the form of the Clydai example, namely, a cross with expanded arms placed within a double circle, as found on one of the Whithorn (co. Wigtown) stones, a form said in Allen's <em>Early Christian Monuments of Scotland</em>, 497, to be `unique'. It is also seen on the Chapel Coleman stone (No. 115) and St. Dogmaels fragment (No. 1012, iii)'.<p>Macalister/1945, 411: `the cross cuts into the Roman letters...[and] we must infer that it is a subsequent addition, and has nothing to do with the inscriptions...The cross is an equilateral cross pattée in a circle, the lines defining it intersecting at the centre. It is mounted upon a plain stem of two lines, not properly centred with respect to the head'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 186: `Subsequently the stone was reset in the ground head downwards and the face filled with a large lightly carved outline `Maltese' ring-cross of Irish form (cf. No. 302 above), with moulded borders to the ring and (intercrossing) arms. Below is a detached double incised (or moulded) stem marked off below by a horizontal line (Fig. 5, 29), probably indicating the limit of the (new) butt (cf. No. 44). The stem and line have been scored through the last four letters of l.1 of the Latin inscription; the ring-cross has obliterated the final I of l.2. 7th--9th century'.</em>

If, as may be conjectured, the cross with its double-lined stem and transverse-lined base is a subsequent addition on the stone, some of the older letters may have been cut through, as indeed seems to have been the case with the E in the second line: since I apprehend the name of the father (<em>Evolenci</em>) is identical with that of <em>Evolenggi</em> on the Llandyssilio stone (ante, p. 113), rather than that it is to be read VOLENCI, as I at first supposed (Arch.
