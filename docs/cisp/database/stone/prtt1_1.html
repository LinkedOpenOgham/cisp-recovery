<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Ling. Notes:</strong><td>Jackson/1953, 623,  speaks of a `gross confusion of cases' in this inscription. Westwood/1879, 38: `Col. Francis thus speaks of this stone, which `was found in 1839 at Port Talbot, between Neath and the Roman station of Bovium. The older inscription, if we may depend on the fidelity of the engraving, is dedicated, not, as some have pretended, to <em>Maximian</em>, but to <em>Maximin</em>, who bears upon his coins the title of <em>Invictus</em> (as upon the stone), which is not found on those of <em>Maximian</em>. The inscription as it now stands may be read thus -- Imp. C. Fla. Val. Maximino Invicto Augus(to). But on looking closer we are led to believe that the first part belongs to a still older inscription, as the C. Fla. Val. (Caius Flavius Valerius) were names which never belonged to Maximin, whose name was Galerius Valerius. (The names of the two Maximians were `Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maximianus' and `Galerius Valerius Maximianus'.) The appellation of C. Flavius Valerius belongs to the second Severus, and it is probable that to him this stone was originally inscribed, but that subsequently his name had been erased to give place to that of Maximin by some person who carelessly or ignorantly overlooked the prenomens.<p>The name of the Emperor Maximinus here recorded (with the title INVICTUS) also occurs in an inscription found in Cumberland, given by Horsley (Brit. Rom. p. 192, No. 40; and conf. Hubner, Inscr. Lat. vii. 1158)'.<p>Macalister/1945, 383--384: `This inscription is outside our scope, but it may be observed that the Imperial <em>praenomina</em> are inaccurate. There were two emperors called Maximinus -- Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus (A.D. 235--238) and Galerius Valerius Maximinus (A.D. 308--314). The latter is doubtless the person intended. Flauius Valerius <em>Seuerus</em> was emperor in 306--7; apparently his <em>praenomina</em> were by some error ascribed in the inscription to his sucessor. Such an error would be most likely to take place just at a change of reign, so that we may confidently date this inscription to A.D. 308'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 161: `The inscription identifies the monument as a Roman milestone, set up originally in the time of the Emperor Maximinus (A.D. 309-13), presumably to mark the repair or rehabilitation of the Roman main S. Wales road where it passed through or near the site of modern Port Talbot'.</em>
<tr valign=baseline> <td><strong>Palaeography:</strong><td>Westwood/1879, 33: `written in large capital letters across the stone...Owing to the crack across the third line there is a little difficulty about the first letter, which has been given as CL in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1840, p. 296, and simply as L in Col. Grant Francis's work on Neath Abbey and its Charters (Swansea, 1845, p. 8). It appears to me to be a D, unless, as is possible, the top of the curved second stroke of the letter should be only part of the crack of the stone. The oblique elongation of the top of the second stroke of the A without a cross bar and the form of the G in the last line are palaeographical peculiarities worthy of notice'.<p>Rhys/1899, 145: `reading, according to Hubner (No. 1158) <em>Imp(eratore) C[aesare) Fla(vio) Val(erio) Maximino invicto Augus(to)</em>. As to the lettering, I noticed that the last two V's have their right limb perpendicular, and so with the tag of the G'.<p>Rhys/1918, 186: `The Roman inscription itself with the three first lines incomplete owing to the loss of one of the six pieces to which the stone was reduced. However, Westwood, in his plate 26, gives all the six pieces, but his plate leaves the third line impossible to read'.<p>Nash-Williams/1950, 161: `Lightly picked Roman capitals, with straight serifs, clumsily formed. The A's have no cross-bar. The F in l. 1 is E-shaped (see No. 27)'.</em>

Among the peculiarities of the lettering may be mentioned that the top of the h, the first A, and the two first T's, stand above all the other letters. The h is the only minuscule of the group, and the first A bulges in the middle like the first A of Carantorius on the Kenfig stone (p. 133).
